Disabling a trigger when the table containing the trigger has triggers disabled is not allowed. Likewise, disabling all triggers of a table when the entire database has triggers disabled is not allowed. Also, disabling triggers from within an Advantage Extended Procedure (AEP) or trigger is not allowed.
