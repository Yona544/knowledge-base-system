Problem: The version number of the ADM (Advantage proprietary memo file) is not recognized by this version of the software. The table and associated memo file were likely created by a newer version of Advantage.

Solution: This is primarily a warning code that is written to the error log. The memo file is structurally compatible with the current version of Advantage, but it will not be able to benefit from the new features. If the new features are necessary, use a newer version of the Advantage software.
