Syntax

property AdsServerTypes : TAdsServerTypes;

Â

TAdsServerType = ( stADS\_REMOTE, stADS\_LOCAL, stADS\_AIS )

Description

This property overrides the TAdsSettings.AdsServerTypes value if the application has a TAdsSettings component. The Advantage server connection for this TAdsConnection component will only attempt to use the server types indicated in the set. If this set is empty, the default, then the TAdsSettings.AdsServerTypes property set will be used.
