Problem: The current user is trying to encrypt a database table or set the database property to encrypt all tables created or added into the database, but the table encryption password property of the database has not been set.

Solution: Set the table encryption password property (ADS\_DD\_ENCRYPT\_TABLE\_PASSWORD) of the database first.
