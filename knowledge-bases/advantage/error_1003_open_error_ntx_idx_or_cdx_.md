Problem: The specified index (NTX, IDX, or CDX) file could not be opened.

Solution: Check to make sure that the specified file exists. If the file is not in the same directory as the application, specify the full path name. Verify the application has the necessary rights to access the file. If the file is available only for read access, open the file read-only.
