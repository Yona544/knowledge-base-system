The current value of variables can be seen in the Variables window, or by hovering your mouse over a variable name in the editor.

The Variables window can be sorted by variable name or by variable data. To sort the grid, simply click on the column you would like to sort. To return to the default ordering, right-click on the header and select Default order from the quick menu.

The Variables window will allow you to view the column information for open cursor variables as well. To view this data, highlight the row with the column variable and expand the row using the plus sign in that row. A detail table will appear with the cursor column names and current data values.

The Variables window provides a list of variables for the current stack frame. To see variables in other stack frames, double-click on the frame of interest in the call stack window.

If you would like to view the variable data in its own window, as opposed to the grid view, double-click the row in question. A new window will appear containing the variable data. This window can be moved and resized. It can also be docked anywhere in the SQL Utility.
