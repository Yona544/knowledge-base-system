Problem: The SQL engine was unable to perform the conversion from one data type to another. This error can occur when using parameterized queries when the data assigned to a parameter does not match the data in the table. It can also occur when using the scalar function CONVERT or CAST incorrectly.

Solution: Verify that the statement is using compatible data types.
