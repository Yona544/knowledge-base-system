Problem: The full text search condition specified in a CONTAINS() function has an unclosed word or phrase.

Solution: Verify that quoted words and phrases have closing quotes. Words and phrases that are opened with double quote values must be closed. To include a double quote character in the search condition, specify two of them in a row.
