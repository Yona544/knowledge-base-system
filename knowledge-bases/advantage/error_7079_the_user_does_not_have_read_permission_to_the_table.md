Problem: The database has been set up to verify users access rights when opening a table or view. The user who is attempting to open the table or view for read access has not been granted read permission to the specified table or view.

Solution: Use the data dictionary administrative API or the Advantage Data Dictionary Management Utility to grant proper permission to the user.
