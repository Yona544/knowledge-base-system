The TAdsSettings component exposes the functionality for Advantage global settings.

Unit

AdsSet

Description

TAdsSettings should be used only if it is important to set such settings as:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| · | The ShowDeleted property if deleted records should or should not be shown when using DBF tables. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| · | The AdsServerTypes property to specify to which Advantage server type(s) connections should be attempted. |

Note It is also possible to specify the Advantage server type(s) through the use of a TAdsConnection component, which is often more convenient than using a global settings component.
