Specific differences exist between some Advantage functionality and native Delphi/C++Builder expected behaviors. In addition to the information below, the topic [How the Advantage SQL Engine Differs from the BDE](master_how_the_advantage_sql_engine_differs_from_the_bde.htm) contains specific differences in the SQL engines.

The following sections discuss the functionality in terms of properties, methods, and events that are currently not supported, and what can be done to achieve equivalent functionality using the Advantage TDataSet Descendant. In a few cases the equivalent functionality must be coded specifically by the developer.
