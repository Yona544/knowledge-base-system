Packages allow developers to create independent name spaces for UDFs. The Connection Repository will allow you to add packages to your database.

To create or modify a package, open a database. See [Opening a Database](arc_opening_a_database2.htm) for details. You must be logged into the database as a user with the CREATE PACKAGE or ALTER permission to add or modify packages.

To add a new package, from the tree view within the Connection Repository, right-click the FUNCTION icon and select Create Package.

To modify a package, from the tree view within the Connection Repository, right-click on the package and select Properties.
