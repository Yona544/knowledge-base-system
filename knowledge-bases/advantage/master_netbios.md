NetBIOS is not a protocol like IPX or IP. NetBIOS is an API that uses other protocols for communication. NetBIOS can run on NetBEUI on LAN segments, IPX, TCP for connection oriented session services over IP, and UDP for datagram services over IP. Advantage uses NetBIOS for discovery of the Advantage Database Server for Windows. See [Advantage Database Server Discovery](master_advantage_database_server_discovery.htm) for more information.
