The AdsStamp Utility is a special application that you can use to upgrade ADS.

There are two primary functions and one secondary function of AdsStamp. The primary functions are related to updating ADS. The first of these features permits you to easily upgrade the ADS to the latest release with a minimum of effort. The second permits you to easily modify your server's license information, which you use most often when you have purchased additional licenses.

The secondary feature available through AdsStamp permits you to change the language configuration for Advantage. This feature is secondary since you can also change this setting using the Advantage Configuration Utility.

One important feature of AdsStamp is that you can distribute it with your applications. It can then be used to provide server upgrades, language configuration, and license upgrades for your installed applications.

AdsStamp is located in the same directory as the Advantage Database Server. For Windows users, the default for this directory is c:\Program Files\Extended Systems\Advantage 8.1\Server.

Before using AdsStamp on an ADS installation, you should stop the currently running server.

AdsStamp is very well documented. For more information on using AdsStamp, search for AdsStamp.exe in the Advantage help index.
