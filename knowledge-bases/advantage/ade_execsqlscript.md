[TAdsQuery](ade_tadsquery.htm)

Important Note: This method is obsolete, and is only included for backwards compatibility. The standard ExecSQL method can now execute SQL scripts, and will execute the scripts at the server (which the ExecSQLScript method does not do). See [Scripts](master_sql_script_overview.htm) in the Advantage SQL Engine Supported Grammar section for more information. The new scripting functionality does not support the same comment characters that the old method did. If you require the old method, continue to use ExecSQLScript.

Executes the statements in the SQL property as an SQL script.

Syntax

procedure ExecSQLScript;

Description

Call ExecSQLScript to execute all SQL statements assigned to the SQL property as a batch job. This method currently supports single-line comments of the form

[ This is a comment ]

or

# This is a comment

Statements included in the script can not return cursor data (no SELECT statements), and should be separated using a semi-colon (;).

Use ExecSQLScript to execute scripts you have written, or scripts generated by the "Tables-To-Code" utility in the Advantage Data Architect.

Note This method does not currently support parameters in SQL statements.

Example
