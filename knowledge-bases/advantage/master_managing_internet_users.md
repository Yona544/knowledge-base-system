User names and passwords are stored in the [Advantage Data Dictionary](master_advantage_data_dictionary.htm). In order to obtain an Internet connection you must connect to the Advantage Data Dictionary regardless of the security level.

You can manage your Internet users in an [Advantage Data Dictionary](master_advantage_data_dictionary.htm) just like you would for your LAN users. You can also use the [Advantage Management Utility](master_advantage_management_utility.htm), located in the [Advantage Data Architect](master_advantage_data_architect.htm), to get information about connected users.
