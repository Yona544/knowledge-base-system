Problem: Replication cannot be performed because the name of the table to be replicated or the name of one of the columns in the table to be replicated contains both the double quote (") character and closing bracket (]) character.

Solution: Avoid using non-standard characters in table names and column names. Restructure the table to remove non-standard characters in column names.
