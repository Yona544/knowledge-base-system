Problem: The version number of the ADI (Advantage proprietary index file) is not recognized by this version of the software. The index file was most likely created by a newer version of Advantage.

Solution: Rebuild the index file using your existing version of Advantage, or upgrade the Advantage software to the latest release if the new features are required.
