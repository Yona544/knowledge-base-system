Advantage was unable to find any IP adapters. This can occur if the IP stack is not correctly configured. Verify the host name is configured correctly and that the host name has an entry in the "hosts" file as well.

If using the Advantage Database Server for Linux, which does not support IPX, this is a fatal error, and the server will not start. If using any other operating system, this error is for informational purposes, and the server will attempt to continue using IPX.
