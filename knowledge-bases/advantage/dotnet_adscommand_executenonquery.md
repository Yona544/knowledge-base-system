Executes an SQL statement and returns the number of rows affected.

public int ExecuteNonQuery();

Remarks

You can use the ExecuteNonQuery to execute statements that do not return result sets (e.g., UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, etc.).

Although the ExecuteNonQuery does not return any rows, any stored procedure output parameters mapped to [AdsParameter](dotnet_adsparameter.htm) objects are still populated with data.

For UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statements, the return value is the number of rows affected by the command. For all other types of statements, the return value is -1.

Example

// create a connection object

AdsConnection conn = new AdsConnection( "data source = c:\\data;" );

AdsCommand cmd;

Â 

// open the connection

conn.Open();

// create a new command object

cmd = new AdsCommand( "update departments set budget = budget \* 1.05",

conn );

// execute the query

Console.WriteLine( "Records affected: " + cmd.ExecuteNonQuery() );
