Many Advantage users have a repository of reports that where built with the R&R ReportWorks XBase edition from Liveware Publishing. Traditionally these reports used direct file access and could not utilize the security features of the Advantage Database Server. In addition, if these reports where accessing tables that where already in use by Advantage, Advantage had to be configured to use its Compatibility Locking Mode, as opposed to its more efficient and secure Proprietary Locking Mode. Starting with Advantage version 10, R&R ReportWorks files using DBF/CDX tables can now be accessed via the Advantage Client Engine.
