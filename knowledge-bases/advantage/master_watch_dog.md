The Advantage Database Server Watch Dog is a process that enhances data integrity. If the Advantage Database Server does not receive a response from a connected client for a configurable amount of time, the connection is automatically closed. All database files that the connection had open will also be closed. (See [Internet Client Timeout](master_internet_client_timeout.htm).)

The client workstations send watchdog packets during periods of inactivity to prevent the Advantage Database Server from closing the connection.
