The ObjectView property specifies whether fields are to be stored hierarchically or flattened out in the Fields property. If this property is True, there can be a hierarchy to the objects in the TFields.Fields array. If this property is False, the fields are stored sequentially in the Fields property. With Advantage, all fields are stored sequentially in the Fields property.
