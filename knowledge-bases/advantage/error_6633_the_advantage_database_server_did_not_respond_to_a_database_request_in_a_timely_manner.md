Problem: This error will occur if the server does not respond to the client while using inter-process communications when the client and server processes are on the same physical workstation.

Solution: Verify that Advantage Database Server is still running. If it is running, then check the [MAX\_TIMEOUTS](master_ads_ini_file_support.htm) value in the ads.ini file. If that value is very small and the server is extremely busy, it is possible that the server might not be able to respond in the timeout period. Increase the value (or remove it from the ads.ini file so that the default value will be used).
