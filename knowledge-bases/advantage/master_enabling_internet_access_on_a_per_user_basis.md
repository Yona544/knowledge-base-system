You are able to configure the Internet access rights for each user in an Advantage Data Dictionary. This can be done using the Advantage Client Engine APIs (See AdsDDSetUserProperty), and can also be configured using the [Advantage Data Architect](master_advantage_data_architect.htm).

Using the Advantage Data Architect:

Note When a user is created in the Data Dictionary, their Internet access is disabled by default.
