This chapter is designed to provide you with an overall picture of Advantage (including what makes it special) and a quick tour of the tools that you will likely use with it, as well as how to build database applications using Advantage. If you are new to Advantage, you will want to read this chapter carefully. Doing so will show you how you can use Advantage in your database applications.

If you are already familiar with Advantage, you probably already know much of what is discussed in this chapter. In that case, you might want to quickly skim this chapter before continuing on to Chapter 2. In particular, you might want to read the section "Features Added in Advantage 8," the latest release of ADS at the time of this writing.
