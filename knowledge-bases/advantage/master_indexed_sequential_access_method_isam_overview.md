Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) is a scheme used to decrease the amount of time necessary to locate a data record within a large table, given a unique [key](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_44303104X,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)) for the record. ISAM databases generally provide better performance than SQL-based relational database systems, especially in small to medium sized network environments. The Advantage Database Server supports two ISAM file formats: Xbase DBF and a Proprietary table format.
