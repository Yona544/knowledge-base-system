[TAdsEvent](ade_tadsevent.htm)

Maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for the events to be signaled.

Syntax

property EventTimeout: Integer

Description

The EventTimeout property is used to specify the amount of time to wait for the configured events to be signaled. Â Since the TAdsEvent component uses an internal thread to repeatedly wait for the configured events, this property controls the amount of time each execution of the sp\_WaitForAnyEvent canned procedure will wait. Note that the timeout period may not be exact to the millisecond because the call requires a call to the server. The timeout period does not include that turnaround time. A value of -1 can be passed to specify an infinite wait.
