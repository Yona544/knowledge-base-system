[Scalar](master_supported_scalar_functions.htm) function that extracts a substring beginning with the first character in a string.

| --- | --- |
| Supported in SQL: | Yes |
| Supported in Navigational: | Yes |

Syntax

LEFT(<cString>, <nCount>) Ã  cSubString

Parameters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| <cString> | A character string from which to extract characters. The maximum size of <cString> is 65,535 (64K) bytes. |
| <nCount> | The number of characters to extract. |

Return Values

LEFT() returns the leftmost <nCount> characters of <cString> as a character string. If <nCount> is negative or zero, LEFT() returns a null string (""). If <nCount> is larger than the length of the character string, LEFT() returns the entire string.

Remarks

LEFT() is a character function that returns a substring of a specified character string. It is the same as SUBSTR(<cString>, 1, <nCount>). LEFT() is also like RIGHT(), which returns a substring beginning with the last character in a string.

LEFT(), RIGHT(), and SUBSTR() are often used with both the AT() and RAT() functions to locate the first and/or the last position of a substring before extracting it.

Note Binary and image fields are not supported by this function. Memo fields are supported by the SQL version of the scalar.
