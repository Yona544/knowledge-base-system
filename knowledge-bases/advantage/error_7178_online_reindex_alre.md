Problem: An online reindex operation was already active on a table when another online reindex operation was requested on the same table.

Solution1: Allow the previous online reindex operation to finish before attempting to reindex the same table again.

Solution2: Cancel the active online reindex operation before attempting to reindex the same table again. Â Consider specifying a timeout value in the sp\_ReindexOnline call if the operation is taking too long.
