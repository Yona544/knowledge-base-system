The "current" value setting for number of users, connections, work areas, tables, indexes, or locks was attempted to be set to a negative value.

In general, 9000 class errors indicate an internal problem within the Advantage server.

On the Windows platform, when Advantage logs a 9000 class error it will also generate a crash dump file. This file will be placed in the error log path (default is c:\), and the filename will be prefixed with "adsdump". Please send this crash dump file, along with all ads\_err error log files to Advantage Technical Support.

For other platforms, please send a small re-creation, along with all ads\_err error log files to Advantage Technical Support.
