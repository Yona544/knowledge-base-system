Problem: The value assigned to a variable is out of the range supported by the type of the variable.

Solution: Check the error message for the location of the error in the script and ensure that that the value assigned to the variable is within the support range for the variable. Variables declared in an SQL script have the same range as the corresponding field type. See [ADT Field Types and Specifications](master_adt_field_types_and_specifications.htm) or [DBF Field Types and Specifications](master_dbf_field_types_and_specifications.htm) for field type specification details.
