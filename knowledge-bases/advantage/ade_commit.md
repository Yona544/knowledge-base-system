Permanently stores all of the database updates, inserts, and deletes sent to the server since the transaction began.

Syntax

procedure Commit;

Description

Call this function to permanently store the database updates, inserts, and deletes made during the transaction. If a connections has [nested transactions](master_nesting_transactions.htm), the nesting level will be decremented, but the work will not be committed.

When used in [nested transactions](master_nesting_transactions.htm), commits of the inner transactions does not commit the data or release locks. Â Only committing the outer most transaction will commit the work and end the transaction.

This method is ignored if the connection is using Advantage Local Server. See [Advantage Transaction Processing](master_transaction_processing_system.htm) for more information.
