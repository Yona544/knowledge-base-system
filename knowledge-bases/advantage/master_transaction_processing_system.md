The Advantage Database Server provides the powerful features of a Transaction Processing System (TPS) for your Advantage applications. Advantage TPS allows an application to perform multiple insert, update, and delete operations to any number of tables with complete confidence that either all of the insert, update, and delete operations will be successful or that none of the operations will occur. In other words, Advantage TPS processes multiple insertions, updates, and deletions as though they were a single operation.
