Retrieves the conditional index expression of this index order if one exists.

Syntax

function AdsGetIndexCondition : String;

Description

A conditional expression is a logical expression that filters the records placed in an index order. Only records that pass the conditional expression are in the index order. If records that do not pass the conditional expression are modified such that they pass the condition, a key is added to the index for that record. If an updated record no longer passes the condition, any associated key is removed from the index.

If no index condition exists, AdsGetIndexCondition will return an empty string.

Example

AdsTable1.Exclusive := TRUE;

AdsTable1.Active := TRUE;

AdsTable1.AdsCreateIndex( '', 'Tag1', 'LastName;DeptNum', 'EmpId>50', '', [] );

AdsTable1.IndexName := 'Tag1';

Â 

strCondition := AdsTable1.AdsGetIndexCondition;

{ strCondition equals EMPID>50 }
