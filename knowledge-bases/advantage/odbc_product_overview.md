The Advantage ODBC Driver is an ODBC version 3 driver based on the [Advantage Client Engine](odbc_advantage_client_engine.htm) that provides SQL access to the [Advantage Database Server](master_advantage_database_server.htm). The driver provides full support for the "Minimum" ODBC SQL grammar specification, as well as many functions included in the "Core" and "Extended" grammar specifications. When used with the Advantage Database Server, ODBC users can have the application stability, performance and reduced network traffic benefits of client/server architecture.
