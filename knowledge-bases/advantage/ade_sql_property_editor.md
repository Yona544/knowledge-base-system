Starting with Advantage version 10, the [TAdsQuery](ade_tadsquery.htm) component no longer uses the default Delphi string list editor when editing the [TAdsQuery.SQL](ade_sql.htm) property. Instead, the same SQL Utility available in the Advantage Data Architect is used. This editor provides many additional features including syntax highlighting, code templates, find/replace functionality, ability to run and preview query results, ability to verify query syntax, ability to debug SQL scripts, etc.
