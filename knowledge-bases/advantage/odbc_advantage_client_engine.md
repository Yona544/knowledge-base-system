The Advantage Client Engine is a custom-designed Windows Application Programming Interface (API) providing client/server access to standard Xbase DBF tables or Advantage proprietary ADT tables using the [Advantage Database Server](master_advantage_database_server.htm). The Advantage Client Engine supports native Windows DLL programming languages such as Borland Delphi, Borland C++Builder, Microsoft Visual Basic, and Microsoft Visual C/C++ and operates as the foundation for the Advantage ODBC Driver interface.
