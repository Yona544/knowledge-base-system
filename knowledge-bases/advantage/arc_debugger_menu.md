Debug commands are located in the SQL menu and on the SQL Utility toolbar. Keyboard shortcuts are also associated with most commands, and are listed next to the command in the menu.

To open the SQL Utility, either press the toolbar button, or select Tools -> SQL Utility from the main menu.

The SQL menu is merged into the main menu once an SQL Utility window has been opened. It can also be accessed via a quick menu by right-clicking inside the SQL utility window.

Commands to start and break a debug session are located in the base SQL menu. Additional debugger commands can be found in the Debug submenu.
