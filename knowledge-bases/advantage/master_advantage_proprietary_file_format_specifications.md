| Maximum length of key expression text and maximum length of conditional expression text | 512 bytes\*\* |
| Maximum length of evaluated key expression | 4082 bytes\*\*\* |

Â 

\*\* The combined length of the index key expression text and conditional expression text must not be longer than 512 bytes.

\*\*\* The maximum length of an ADI index key is limited by the index page size. Refer to [Index Key Size and Page Size Relationships](master_index_key_size_and_page_size_relationships.htm) for the specific equations.

The maximum number of fields per table depends on field name lengths, and can be calculated by: 65135 / ( 10 + AverageFieldNameLength ). For example, if the average field name length is:

10 - then the maximum number of fields per table is 3256 fields

20 - then the maximum number of fields per table is 2171 fields

30 - then the maximum number of fields per table is 1628 fields.
