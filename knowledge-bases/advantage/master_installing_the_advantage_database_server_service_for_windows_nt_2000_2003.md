| 4. | To properly perform string comparisons with local languages, Advantage provides OEM/localized character sets to match your country's language requirements. If your Advantage application uses OEM/localized character sets, select the character set that matches your Advantage client applications. Selecting a specific OEM/Localized character set for all Advantage installs (including Advantage Local Server) will guarantee the OEM/Localized character sets used by all Advantage applications will be the same. If your Advantage applications use ANSI character sets only, select Next. |

| 5. | To properly perform string comparisons when using ANSI collation, Advantage provides ANSI character sets to match your country's language requirements. If your Advantage application uses ANSI character sets, select an ANSI character set to be used on the Advantage Database Server. If <CURRENT SYSTEM LANGUAGE> is chosen, the currently configured ANSI character set will be used. If you do not wish to use the ANSI character set that is currently active, this setting can be used to select a specific character set. Selecting a specific ANSI language for all Advantage installs (including Advantage Local Server), rather than selecting <CURRENT SYSTEM LANGUAGE>, will guarantee the ANSI character sets used by all Advantage applications will be the same. It is recommended that <CURRENT SYSTEM LANGUAGE> not be chosen unless this is the only Advantage Database Server installation. |
