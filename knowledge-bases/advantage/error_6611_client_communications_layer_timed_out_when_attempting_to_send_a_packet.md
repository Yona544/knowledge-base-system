When using IPX communication with a 16-bit application, this error indicates that the communications layer timed out while waiting for a free ECB to use to send data to the Advantage Database Server.

With 32-bit applications, this error indicates that the send on a socket timed out. It may mean that the connection was dropped due to a network failure.
