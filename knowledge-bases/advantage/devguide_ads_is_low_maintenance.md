Most database servers require a database administrator to keep them running smoothly and efficiently. And database administrators often require advanced training and certification. But with ADS, most applications require little or no maintenance. In most cases, once the ADS server is installed, you can pretty much forget about it other than ensuring that your data gets backed up regularly.

"How can this be?" you ask. Once again, this is largely due to the underlying architecture of ADS. For example, so long as you use the Advantage proprietary format for your data tables, space previously occupied by deleted records is automatically recovered when new records are added. Similarly, ADS's legendary stability makes it unnecessary to rebuild indexes, in most cases.

That ADS-based databases require little or no maintenance makes this server particularly attractive for applications that are distributed to many different locations. For example, if you license your application to many different clients, the less you or they have to worry about managing the database server, the better. This is why ADS is a good choice for vertical market applications and for applications that are deployed to many different systems.
