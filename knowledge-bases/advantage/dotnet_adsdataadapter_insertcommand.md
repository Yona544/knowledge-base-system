Gets or sets an SQL statement or stored procedure to insert new records into the data source.

public AdsCommand InsertCommand { get; set; }

Remarks

During [AdsDataAdapter.Update](dotnet_adsdataadapter_update.htm), if this property is not set and primary key information is present in the DataSet, the InsertCommand can be generated automatically if you set the [AdsDataAdapter.SelectCommand](dotnet_adsdataadapter_selectcommand.htm) property and use the [AdsCommandBuilder](dotnet_adscommandbuilder.htm). Then, any additional commands that you do not set are generated by the AdsCommandBuilder.

When InsertCommand is assigned to a previously created [AdsCommand](dotnet_adscommand.htm), the AdsCommand is not cloned. The InsertCommand maintains a reference to the previously created AdsCommand object.

Note If execution of this command returns rows (e.g., from a stored procedure), these rows may be added to the DataSet depending on how you set the [AdsCommand.UpdatedRowSource](dotnet_adscommand_updatedrowsource.htm) property.
