This is a calculation that is done on the two other fields "Total Packets Received" and "Check Sum Failures." The "Percent of Total Packets" is the percent of packets that failed in light of the total packets received. For example, if 100 packets were received and the check sum failure was 50, the percent of total packets would be 50%.
