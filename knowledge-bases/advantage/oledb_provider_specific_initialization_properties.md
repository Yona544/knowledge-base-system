| Provider-Specific Initialization Properties  Advantage OLE DB Provider (for ADO) |  |  |  |  |

In the provider-specific property set DBPROPSET\_ADSDBINIT, the Advantage OLE DB Provider defines the additional initialization properties described in the following table. All of these properties are "data source wide", meaning all sessions and tables opened under this data source will adhere to these properties.

| Property ID | Description |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_CHAR\_TYPE | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: ADS\_ANSI  Description: Specifies whether the data in the DBF tables is ANSI or OEM. Valid values include ADS\_ANSI and ADS\_OEM. This setting is applicable to the ADS\_CDX, ADS\_VFP, and ADS\_NTX TableType options. When using ADS\_ADT and ADS\_VFP tables, the value can also be one of the [dynamically loaded collations](master_collation_support.htm). |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_ENCRYPTION\_PASSWORD | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: (no password)  Description: Specifies the encryption password to use with all tables on [Free Connections](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_1940894724X,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)). For [Database Connections](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_2045887057,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)) (see DBPROP\_INIT\_DATASOURCE), this property is not used. Database Connections should use the User ID and Password properties (DBPROP\_AUTH\_USERID and DBPROP\_AUTH\_PASSWORD). |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_FILTER\_OPTIONS | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: IGNORE\_WHEN\_COUNTING  Description: Specifies whether to respect the filtering applied to the rowset when determining record count and logical positioning information. Valid values are IGNORE\_WHEN\_COUNTING and RESPECT\_WHEN\_COUNTING. When using RESPECT\_WHEN\_COUNTING, the record count and scroll bar positioning will be accurate but with a potential speed tradeoff. In some cases, the provider may have to skip through all records in the rowset to determine the count and position. It is not recommended to use this option except on very small rowsets. When a rowset is to be opened and displayed in a data bound grid, the grid requests record count information from the provider to position the scroll bar. Because it can request this information several times for any movement in the grid, it is usually best if the IGNORE\_WHEN\_COUNTING option is used in order for the grid to be more responsive. If you use the ADO RecordSet property .RecordCount and need a completely accurate count, then use the RESPECT\_WHEN\_COUNTING option. All record count requests are sent to the same OLE DB interface, so it is not possible for it to know implicitly how accurate the count should be for a given call. The default is IGNORE\_WHEN\_COUNTING. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_INCREMENT\_USERCOUNT | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: FALSE  Description: Specifies whether to increment the user count on the Advantage Database Server even if the current PC is already connected. Valid values are TRUE and FALSE. With a value of FALSE, if the same PC connects to Advantage more than one time the connections are counted as a single user and only the connection count is incremented. With a value of TRUE, each connection counts as a new user on the Advantage Database Server. This property allows an Advantage middleware type of application to increment the Advantage Database Server user count for each remote client workstation indirectly accessing the Advantage Database Server. This provides an easy way for Advantage middleware applications to abide by the Advantage Database Server license agreement as related to remote client workstations taking up a "user" toward the maximum number of licensed users. The default is FALSE. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_LOCK\_MODE | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: ADS\_PROPRIETARY\_LOCKING  Description: Specifies the locking mode to use with DBF tables. Valid values include ADS\_PROPRIETARY\_LOCKING and ADS\_COMPATIBLE\_LOCKING. This setting is applicable to the ADS\_CDX, ADS\_VFP, and ADS\_NTX ADSPROP\_INIT\_TABLE\_TYPE options. If set to ADS\_PROPRIETARY\_LOCKING, Advantages high-performance internal locking mode is used. If set to ADS\_COMPATIBLE\_LOCKING, DBF tables can be shared in a writable mode with non-Advantage database applications. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_SECURITY\_MODE | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: ADS\_CHECKRIGHTS  Description: Specifies the security mode to use. Valid values include ADS\_CHECKRIGHTS and ADS\_IGNORERIGHTS. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_SERVER\_TYPE | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: ADS\_REMOTE\_SERVER | ADS\_AIS\_SERVER  Description: Specifies the Advantage server types to which connections should be attempted. Valid values include ADS\_REMOTE\_SERVER, ADS\_AIS\_SERVER, and ADS\_LOCAL\_SERVER. These values can be logically Ored together with the vertical bar character "|" in order to choose multiple server types. If multiple types are specified and multiple server types are available, the order of precedence is ADS\_REMOTE\_SERVER first, ADS\_AIS\_SERVER second, and ADS\_LOCAL\_SERVER third. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_SHOW\_DELETED | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: FALSE  Description: Specifies whether deleted records in DBF tables are visible. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. This setting is applicable to the ADS\_CDX, ADS\_VFP, and ADS\_NTX ADSPROP\_INIT\_TABLE\_TYPE options. If set to TRUE, deleted records in the DBF table will be visible. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_TABLE\_TYPE | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: ADS\_ADT  Description: The desired table type to open. Valid values include ADS\_ADT, ADS\_CDX, ADS\_VFP, and ADS\_NTX. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_TRIM\_TRAILING\_SPACES | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: FALSE  Description: Specifies whether trailing white space is removed from string fields when the data is retrieved. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE is specified, then fields of type DBTYPE\_STR will have trailing white spaced trimmed on retrieval. Note that the Advantage data types ADS\_STRING and ADS\_MEMO are both mapped to DBTYPE\_STR. If FALSE is specified, then trailing white space is maintained on the values when they are retrieved. This means that a fixed length field (ADS\_STRING) with a width of 10, for example, will always return 10 characters when the value is retrieved; it is padded with as many spaces as necessary. It may be desirable to specify TRUE to trim trailing blanks if, for example, an application is using the ADO Find method. If trailing blanks are not trimmed, then search values given to the Find method would have to be padded to the full field length in order for the search to succeed. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_USE\_NULLS | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: FALSE  Description: Specifies whether DBF tables are to return NULL for column data that is ordinarily considered as "empty" in Xbase terminology. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. This setting is applicable to the ADS\_CDX and ADS\_NTX ADSPROP\_INIT\_TABLE\_TYPE options. If set to TRUE, "empty" column values in DBF tables will be returned as NULL. If set to FALSE, "empty" column values in DBF tables will be returned as actual valid data. This setting is not applicable to ADS\_VFP tables, which have true NULL value support. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_STORED\_PROCEDURE\_CONNECTION | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: FALSE  Description: Specifies if this connection lives within a stored procedure executed on the behalf of remote clients. Valid values are TRUE and FALSE. If this property is set to TRUE, the application will not increment the server user count for the stored procedure. If it is FALSE, then the stored procedure will increment the server user count, which will prevent other users from connecting when the user count reaches the maximum. The default is FALSE. Connections to Advantage Local Server are not affected by this property. |
| ADSPROP\_INIT\_COMPRESSION | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read/Write  Default: not set  Description: Specifies the option for [communications compression](master_communications_compression.htm). Valid values are INTERNET, ALWAYS, and NEVER. If INTERNET is specified, then all data communications for ADS\_AIS\_SERVER connections will be compressed unless compression is specifically turned off at the server. If ALWAYS is specified, then all data communications between the client and server will be compressed unless compression is specifically turned off at the server. If NEVER is specified, then compression will not be used for communications between the client and server. If this property is not specified, then the COMPRESSION setting in the ADS.INI file will be used if available. This property is ignored for ADS\_LOCAL\_SERVER connections. |
