Problem: The AX\_TPSCleanup() function failed to complete a failed transaction recovery.

Solution: Make sure the table or index files associated with the failed transaction were not opened by another application. This error can also occur if the transaction log file could not be opened. Refer to the error log file, ADS\_ERROR.ADT or ADS\_ERR.DBF, for more specific errors related to this failure.
