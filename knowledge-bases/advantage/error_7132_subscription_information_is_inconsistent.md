Problem: An inconsistency was detected in the data in the replication queue.

Solution: This is generally an unexpected error. It can occur if you edit the replication queue manually while replication updates are being processed. Do not modify data in the replication queue. If this did not happen, please send a small re-creation to Advantage Technical Support.
