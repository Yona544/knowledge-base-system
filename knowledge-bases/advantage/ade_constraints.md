Constraints are used to read or add record-level constraints to the dataset. Record-level constraints usually impose relationships between the fields in a single record. BDE dataset components support check constraints that define the values that can be entered into a single record. The TCheckConstraints object maintains the collection of check constraints that apply to a given dataset. This functionality is not implemented with the Advantage TDataSet Descendant. In order for an application to support an enforced constraint to a user, the developer will need to configure the constraints using an [Advantage Data Dictionary](master_advantage_data_dictionary.htm).
