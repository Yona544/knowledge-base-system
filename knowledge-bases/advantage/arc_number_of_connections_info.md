This is the initial number of connections that can be active at one time.

With Advantage DOS client applications, a connection is an individual application that can access the Advantage Database Server.

With Advantage Windows client applications, a connection is defined as an individual 16-bit application, and individual thread in a 32-bit application, or it can be obtained by a call to the specific Advantage Windows Client API to obtain a new connection.

Each user can have multiple active connections.
