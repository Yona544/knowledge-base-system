The Advantage Database Server Service must be started in order to use the Configuration Utility. If the Configuration Utility has been started while the Advantage Database Server Service is stopped or not started, the message, "ADS Service not started" will display next to Service Up Time. In addition, all information in the Database Info window and the Installation Info window will appear blank. The Configuration Utility tab and all configuration sub-tabs, however, will be functional.

If the Advantage Database Server Service has been started after the Configuration Utility has been started, click the Connect button. Database and Installation information will be displayed for the newly started Advantage Database Server Service.
