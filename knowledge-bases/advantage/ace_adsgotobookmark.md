Parameters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| hTable (I) | Handle of table or cursor. |

Remarks

This function is equivalent to [AdsGotoRecord](ace_adsgotorecord.htm). Currently, hBookmark as returned from AdsGetBookmark is the record number.

Note Explicitly moving to a deleted record when using the Advantage proprietary table format (ADT) is an illegal operation and will return the error 5022 (AE\_INVALID\_RECORD\_NUMBER), invalid record number.

Â 

Note This function is capable of utilizing registered callback functions. To learn more about callback functionality and how it behaves with this function, see [Callback Functionality](master_callback_functionality.htm).
