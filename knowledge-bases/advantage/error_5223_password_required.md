Problem: The data dictionary could not be created because a dictionary password was not provided.

Solution: Verify that the dictionary password is provided. See the [DDPassword connection option](ace_adsconnect101.htm) if using the API or via the [CREATE DATABASE](master_create_database.htm) syntax if using SQL.
