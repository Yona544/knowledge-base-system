Problem: An operation was performed that is not legal to perform with the current user's privileges. Most often this error is returned when a user attempts to change another users password, Internet access property, or logins disabled property.

Solution: Log in as the administrator (ADSSYS) or as the specified user to perform the operation. This error code has the same meaning as the 5054 AE\_PERMISSION\_DENIED error.
