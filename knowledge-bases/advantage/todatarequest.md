To create a new instance of TODataRequest drag and drop TODataRequest on form in RAD Studio or by instantiating an instance in the code. Modify the client property of this component to refer to the TODataClient component which you have instantiated earlier. Then modify the response property of this component to refer to the TODataResponse component which you have instantiated earlier.The execution of this component will fetch the data from the server specified in the client component and the responded data will be received by the TODataResponse component.
