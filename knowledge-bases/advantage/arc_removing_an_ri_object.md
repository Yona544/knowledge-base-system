Note Removing an RI Object can lead to possible logical corruption in your [database tables](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_201684107,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)). Advantage will no longer enforce the RI rules for the selected Parent / Child table pairs.

To remove an RI object:

Click the RI object link and click Delete, or right-click on the RI node in the Tree View and select Delete.
