Default = 0

If the DISABLE\_FREE\_CONNECTIONS configuration parameter is set to a non-zero value, then the Advantage Database Server will not allow any connections to be made to the server that are not to an Advantage Data Dictionary. This can provide an added level of security at the server because it allows you to force all connections to be authenticated through the data dictionary.
