Returns user information for the specified table and record number.

Syntax

EXECUTE PROCEDURE sp\_mgGetLockOwner( TableName,Character,255;

RecordNumber,Integer )

Parameters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| TableName (I) | Full qualified path to the table. |
| RecordNumber (I) | Locked Record number. |
| UserName (O) | Name of the connected user |
| ConnNumber (O) | NetWare connection number. (Deprecated) |
| DictionaryUser (O) | Name of user that has authenticated to an Advantage Data Dictionary. |
| Address (O) | IP or IPX address of the connected user. |
| LockType (O) | Type of lock. The value will be File Lock, Record Lock or No Lock. |
| OSUserLoginName (O) | Operating system login name of the connected user. |
| TSAddress (O) | Terminal Server Client IP address if the connection is made from a Terminal Server session. |

Remarks

You must use the fully qualified path and file name for the TableName parameter. The RecordNumber is an integer value representing the locked record number (or 0 if you are checking for a table lock). You can get a list of locked records on a table using the sp\_mgGetAllLocks procedure.

Note With the Advantage Local Server, sp\_mgGetLockOwner will only return information, if the lock was instantiated by the instance of Advantage Local Server currently loaded into memory. It is not possible to determine the owner of a lock instantiated from other instances of the Advantage Local Server.
