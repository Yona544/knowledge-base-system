Advantage proprietary tables (ADTs) support some additional field types that are not available in Xbase tables. These types include Short Integer, Time, Raw, RowVersion, and ModTime. ADT tables and Visual FoxPro (VFP) tables both support Auto Increment, Time Stamp (DateTime), Money (Currency), VarChar, and VarBinary field types that are not available in the other Xbase table types.
