To add tables to the ER view:

Left-click a table in the table list and drag it onto the ER View Window.

The table will be drawn on the ER View Window. If a table exists with the same name, an error message will appear and no table will be drawn.

Once a table is added to the ER View Window, it can be used to create an RI object. If the table is added to the ER View Window and not added to an RI object, it will not be shown in the window the next time the database is opened.

If you click on a table in the table list that exists in the ER View window, the window will be positioned so that the table is in view.
