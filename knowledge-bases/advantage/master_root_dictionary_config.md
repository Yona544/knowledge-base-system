Default = none

The Root\_Dictionary configuration parameter (if given) specifies the path and file name of the [root dictionary](master_root_dictionary.htm). When a dictionary is opened for the first time, the full path and name of the dictionary is compared to this configuration value and if it matches, the dictionary is marked as the root.
