To create a new instance of TODataResponse drag and drop TODataReresponse on form in RAD Studio or by instantiating an instance in the code. Then modify TODataRequest and TODataResponseDataSetAdaptor to be associated with this response component by setting its response property to reference this new TODataResponse component. After the execution of request from the client, the content property of TODataResponse will contain the responded data from the server in JSON format.
