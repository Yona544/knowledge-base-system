Advantage supports a small collection of stored procedures that you use to manage your tables. These procedures are listed separately from those listed in the preceding section for the management of data dictionaries since these procedures can be used both on free tables and on data dictionarybound tables.

The table information and maintenance system stored procedures are listed in Table 14-14.
