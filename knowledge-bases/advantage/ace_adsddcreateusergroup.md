Remarks

AdsDDCreateUserGroup creates a user group object in the database. A user group can be used to logically group users with similar object access rights together. By default, a user inherits rights from the groups that he is a member of. By granting rights to user groups instead of users, it makes it simpler to add and remove access rights to multiple users. A user can become a member of a user group by calling the [AdsDDAddUserToGroup](ace_adsddaddusertogroup.htm) API.

CREATE USER GROUP permissions are required to create a data dictionary user group. See [Advantage Data Dictionary User Permissions](master_advantage_data_dictionary_user_permissions.htm) for more information.

Note When a database is created, it is by default to not perform access rights checking. In order to enforce the access rights of the users, the ADS\_DD\_VERIFY\_ACCESS\_RIGHTS property of the database must be set to True by calling the [AdsDDSetDatabaseProperty](ace_adsddsetdatabaseproperty.htm) API.

Â 

Note This function can be called inside a transaction, but will not be part of the transaction. Any changes it makes cannot be rolled back.

Example

After making a connection to the database, create a user group named "Managers" in the database and grant the user group read and update permissions to the "Employees" table.

AdsConnect60( "n:\\MyData\\myData.ADD", ADS\_REMOTE\_SERVER, "ADSSYS", NULL, ADS\_DEFAULT, &hDD );

ulReturnCode = AdsDDCreateUserGroup( hDD, "Managers", "All managers are in this group." );

ulReturnCode = AdsDDGrantPermission( hDD, ADS\_DD\_TABLE\_OBJECT, "Employees", NULL, "Managers",

ADS\_PERMISSION\_READ | ADS\_PERMISSION\_UPDATE );
