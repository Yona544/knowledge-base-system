The Windows Registry serves as a repository for storing program and configuration information. The Registry is organized in a tree structure and is maintained individually on every Windows Server or Workstation. The database-like structure of the Registry provides information that was usually only available in CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, WIN.INI, or SYSTEM.INI files on a Windows system.
