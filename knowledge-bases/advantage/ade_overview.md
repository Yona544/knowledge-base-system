The TDataSet Switch utility allows developers to maintain multiple projects on a single PC, even if each project uses a different version of the Advantage TDataSet Descendant.

The utility provides an automated mechanism which modifies the version of the Advantage TDataSet Descendant that the IDE uses, in addition to updating the Advantage Client Engine DLLs in the path.

The utility is installed with the Advantage TDataSet Descendant (Delphi 3 through 7) and the Advantage Delphi Components. The TDataSet\_Switch.exe program is installed in the "Switch" subdirectory of the Advantage TDataSet Descendant installation directory. By default, the utility is installed to:

C:\Program Files\Advantage X.X\TDataSet\Switch\TDataSet\_Switch.exe
