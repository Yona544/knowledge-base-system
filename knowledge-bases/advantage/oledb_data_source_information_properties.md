| Data Source Information Properties  Advantage OLE DB Provider (for ADO) |  |  |  |  |

The Advantage OLE DB Provider implements the following properties in the DBPROPSET\_DATASOURCEINFO property set. All of these properties are in the Data Source Information property group. These properties are read-only in the Advantage OLE DB Provider and constitute a set of static information about the provider and data store.

| --- | --- |
| Property ID | Description |
| DBPROP\_ACTIVESESSIONS | Type: VT\_I4  Typical R/W: Read-only  Description: Active Sessions  Specifies the maximum number of sessions that can exist at the same time. For the Advantage OLE DB Provider, this property is set to 0 because an unlimited number of sessions is supported. |
| DBPROP\_ASYNCTXNABORT | Type: VT\_BOOL  Typical R/W: Read-only  Description: Asynchronous Abort  Specifies whether asynchronous abortion of transactions is allowed. For the Advantage OLE DB Provider, this property is set to VARIANT\_FALSE because asynchronous operations are not supported. |
| DBPROP\_ASYNCTXNCOMMIT | Type: VT\_BOOL  Typical R/W: Read-only  Description: Asynchronous Commit  Specifies whether asynchronous commitment of transactions is allowed. For the Advantage OLE DB Provider, this property is set to VARIANT\_FALSE because asynchronous operations are not supported. |
| DBPROP\_BYREFACCESSORS | Type: VT\_BOOL  Typical R/W: Read-only  Description: Pass By Ref Accessors  Specifies whether the provider supports the DBACCESSOR\_PASSBYREF flag in IAccessor::CreateAccessor. This applies both to row and to parameter accessors. For the Advantage OLE DB Provider, this property is set to VARIANT\_FALSE because By Ref accessors are not supported. |
| DBPROP\_CATALOGLOCATION | Type: VT\_I4  Typical R/W: Read-only  Description: Indicates the position of the catalog name in a text command. The value for the Advantage OLE DB Provider is DBPROPVAL\_CL\_START to indicate that the path (if supplied) is at the beginning of the name - for example, "\\server\vol\path\test.adt". Only tables in [Free Connections](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_1940894724X,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)) can be qualified with path information. |
| DBPROP\_CATALOGTERM | Type: VT\_BSTR  Typical R/W: Read-only  Description: Indicates the name the used for a catalog. With the Advantage OLE DB Provider, the value is either "directory" or "data dictionary" depending on if the connection is a [Free Connection](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_1940894724X,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)) or a [Database Connection](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_2045887057,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)). |
