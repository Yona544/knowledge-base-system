The Database or Data Dictionary Path may be setup using the Browse button or may be explicitly typed. For connections not involving an Advantage Data Dictionary (free connections), it should be a valid path name to where the data files are located (e.g., x:\data). This path is used to automatically select all tables in the specified directory. For connections involving an Advantage Data Dictionary (database connections), it should be a valid path name including the Advantage Data Dictionary file name (e.g., x:\database\mydictionary.add).
