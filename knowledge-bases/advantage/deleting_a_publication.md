To delete a Publication, open a database. See [Opening a Database](arc_opening_a_database2.htm) for details. You must login to the database as a user with DROP permissions on the specific publication in order to delete a Â publication from a database. From the tree view within the Connection Repository, right-click the Publication's name icon and select Delete.
