| UNSIGNED32 | AdsBeginTransaction (ADSHANDLE hConnect); |

Parameters

| hConnect (I) | Connection handle on which to start transaction. If this is 0, then a transaction will be started on all connected servers. |

Remarks

If a transaction is not active on a connection then a transaction will be started. Â If a transaction is active a [nested transaction](master_nesting_transactions.htm) will be started. If zero is passed as the connection handle, then the Advantage Client Engine begins a transaction on all connections that do not already have an active transaction. . Any connection with an active transaction will start a nested transaction.

Note AdsBeginTransaction has no effect when used with the Advantage Local Server.
