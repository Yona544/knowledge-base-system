With Advantage ADT files, the Advantage Compatibility Locking mode allows data to be shared by Advantage Local Server applications simultaneously. Locks in one Advantage Local Server application are made visible to other Advantage Local Server applications by obtaining network operating system locks. Files are opened in the mode specified by the application. Therefore, multiple Advantage Local Server applications can have the same files open at the same time in a read/write mode.

With ADT files, Advantage Compatibility locking is not available with the Advantage Database Server. Advantage Compatibility locking is only available with the Advantage Local Server.
