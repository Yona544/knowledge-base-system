The Advantage Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET Client Kit is intended for programmers who wish to create new applications or modify existing Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET applications to work with the [Advantage Database Server](master_advantage_database_server.htm).

The Advantage Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET Client Kit consists of [Replaceable Database Drivers](vo_advantage_rdds.htm) (RDDs), the Advantage Client Engine, and Advantage communication libraries. These libraries must be linked into your Visual Objects or Vulcan.NET applications to access the Advantage Database Server.

Advanced Advantage functions are provided to go beyond the Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET defined language. These advanced functions allow you to finely tune your application to maximize the benefits of Advantage and client/server technology.

This Help file documents the Advantage Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET RDDs and communication libraries. For information regarding the Advantage Client Engine, refer to the Advantage Client Engine Help documentation included in this help file.

For Advantage error information, the Advantage Error Guide Help documentation is also included in this help file.
