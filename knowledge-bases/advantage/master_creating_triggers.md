Triggers can be created either by using the Advantage Data Architect (ARC) or executing an SQL statement.

SQL details can be found in the "Advantage SQL" help book, under the CREATE TRIGGER documentation.

ARC details can be found in the "Triggers" chapter of the "Advantage Data Architect" help book.
