Advantage locking may be set to Proprietary or Compatible.

Advantage Database Server, as default, maintains all locking control through a proprietary locking system. The Advantage locking system allows Advantage to be more efficient to provide better performance gains. It requires all applications sharing the database files to also be Advantage applications. If non-Advantage applications must share DBF data with Advantage applications, Advantage locking must be set to Compatible. When using Advantage-proprietary ADT tables, proprietary locking is always used. When using Advantage Local Server, this setting is ignored.
