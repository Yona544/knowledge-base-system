User defined functions are reusable routines that you write in SQL. Once you have defined a user defined function, it can be used just like a SQL scalar function.

User defined functions return a value. That value can be used in any expression that supports data of that type returned by your user defined function. Creating and using user defined functions is described in Chapter 13.
