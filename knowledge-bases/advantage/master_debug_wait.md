Waits for the execution of any debuggee in the current debugger session to end.

Syntax

DEBUG WAIT

Â 

Remarks

The DEBUG WAIT statement causes the current debugger session to wait until a debuggee is suspended or the DEBUG WAIT is cancelled. Putting the debugger into wait mode allows the debugger to respond to a break point immediately without the need to poll the [::DEBUG\_CONNECTIONS](master__debug_connections.htm) table. Once the statement returns, the [::DEBUG\_CONNECTIONS](master__debug_connections.htm) table can be examined to determine the connection that has been suspended and the appropriate [DEBUG RUN](master_debug_run.htm) command to issue.

If there is already a suspended debuggee when this statement is executed, the statement will return immediately.

To cancel the statement, see AdsRegisterCallBackFunction(). When the statement is cancelled success is returned.

Example

// Set a transient break point at the beginning of the script

// execution on a query handle and do not return until the

// break point was hit.

DEBUG BREAK POINT "CONN0001xxxx" STATEMENT "STMT0001yyyy" AT 0 TRANSIENT;

DEBUG WAIT; // wait for the debuggee suspension
