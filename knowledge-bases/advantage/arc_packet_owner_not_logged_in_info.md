The Advantage Database Server was unable to communicate with a client properly and closed the connection. This occurs when a request for an operation, such as a Seek, is made before the user is properly connected to the Advantage Database Server. Verify your application is properly connecting to the Advantage Database Server. This value is incremented when the Advantage Database Server initiates a disconnect, and the client is still generating disconnect requests.
