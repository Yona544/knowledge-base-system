To create a new report that uses the Advantage Crystal Reports driver:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Create a new report as you normally would with Crystal. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | When prompted to select the data you will be reporting on, expand the 'Create New Connection' tree item. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 3. | Expand the 'Advantage' tree item. All Advantage alias entries will be shown in the list. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 4. | If you have never configured an Advantage alias, see [Defining a Database Alias for use with Crystal Reports](crystal_defining_a_database_alias_for_use_with_crystal_reports.htm) for a description and example ads.ini file. Select the desired Advantage entry in the list and continue developing the report. This is the only Advantage-specific selection you will have to make. |
