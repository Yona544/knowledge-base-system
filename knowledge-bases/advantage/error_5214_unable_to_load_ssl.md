Problem: Â The Advantage client was not able to load the OpenSSL libraries. In order to use [AES encryption](master_encryption.htm) or [TLS communications](master_communications_encryption.htm), you must have the FIPS Encryption Security Option available.

Solution: If the libraries are available, verify that they are in a path location that the client application can access.
