Field names and index order names in the Xbase file format may only contain the letters a-z and A-Z, digits 0-9, and the underscore \_ character. Field names and index order names in the Advantage proprietary file format may contain any character value except 0 (NULL), ; (a semi-colon), or , (a comma). If you have the need for nearly any character value in field names or index order names, you will have to use the Advantage proprietary file format.
