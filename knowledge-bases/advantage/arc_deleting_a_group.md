To delete a group, open a database. See [Opening a Database](arc_opening_a_database2.htm) for details. You must login to the database as a user with DROP permissions on the specific group in order to delete a group from a database. From the tree view within the Connection Repository, right-click the Group's name icon and select Delete.
