Problem: The SQL engine encountered the use of an operator that was not compatible with the operands. For example, the LIKE operator cannot be used with date fields. Also, you cannot compare mismatched data types. For example, " WHERE datefield = numericfield" is not valid.

Solution: Verify that the operators and operands match.
