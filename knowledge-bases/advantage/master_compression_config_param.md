Default = Internet

Valid values include:

InternetUse compression for ADS\_AIS\_SERVER (Internet) connections.

AlwaysUse compression unless the client specifically turns it off.

NeverDo not allow compression for any connections. This setting overrides any client compression settings.

This value controls whether or not compression is used for communications between client and server. In general, it makes sense to use compression when the network is the bottleneck (e.g., connections through a 56K modem). See [Communications Compression](master_communications_compression.htm) for more information.
