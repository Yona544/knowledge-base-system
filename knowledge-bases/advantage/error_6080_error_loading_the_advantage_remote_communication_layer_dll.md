Problem: The Advantage remote communication layer DLL(s) could not be loaded. Communication with the Advantage Database Server will not be possible.

Solution: Put the Advantage communications DLL(s) somewhere in your client PC's search path (e.g., the application folder). The Advantage 32-bit Windows communication DLL is axcws32.dll, and the 64-bit version is named axcws64.dll.
