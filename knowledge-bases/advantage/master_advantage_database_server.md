Advantage Database Server is a high performance client/server RDBMS for stand-alone, networked, Internet, and mobile database applications. Advantage Database Server allows developers the flexibility to combine powerful SQL statements and relational data access methods with the performance and control of navigational commands. Advantage has native development interfaces designed to leverage existing knowledge of popular development tools. With optimized data access methodology for easily delivering unparalleled performance, Advantage provides security, stability, and data integrity while being completely maintenance-free.

The Advantage Database Server is the key to improved database performance in network environments. The server can be visualized as an intelligent controller that reduces competition for resources and off-loads much of the work normally performed by each client workstation. It is responsible for all database access, including all reading and writing of data, and lock management. Working with the network operating system, the Advantage Database Server processes data requests and returns the information to the network clients.

The Advantage Database Server supports the Windows and Linux operating systems. The Advantage Database Server for Windows operates as a Windows Service.
