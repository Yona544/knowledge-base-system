Problem: Extra indexes belonging to the alter table were found open but not specified in the ALTER call.

Solution1: Add the extra non-auto open indexes to a data dictionary to ensure they get opened during the ALTER call.

Solution2: Close all other instances of the table being altered so no extra indexes are found. Â Only do this if you are certain the changes during the alter do not require rebuilding the extra indexes.
