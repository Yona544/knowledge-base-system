The Advantage Internet Connector is a license that allows an unlimited number of internet users access to a single copy of the Advantage Database Server. An internet user is any person using an application that interacts with a web server or middleware software product via an internet connection to gain access to data from an Advantage Database Server. The web server or middleware must be a product that physically interacts with the data on behalf of the remote Internet user, rather than just a router or VPN-like product that simply routes the data between the remote client machine and the Advantage Database Server. By purchasing an Advantage Internet Connector license, an unlimited number of internet users are able to access a company's web server and then query information on their Advantage Database Server back-end database. If you are using the Advantage Database Server on a LAN or WAN, there is no need to purchase the Advantage Internet Connector.
