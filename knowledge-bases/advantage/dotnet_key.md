Index keys are the individually sorted elements in an index order that reference a record in a table. What a record is to a table, a key is to an index. In other words, if an index order exists on the lastname field, and if record 69 in the table has the value "S[.NET Data Providers and Code Portability](dotnet__net_data_providers_and_code_portability.htm) mith" in the lastname field, then the index order would have a "Smith" key that references record 69.
