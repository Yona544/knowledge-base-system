General Protection Faults (GPFs) are errors in Windows applications which may occur when the application attempts to execute an invalid operation, access an invalid segment or access beyond the end of a valid segment.

If an application that uses an Advantage RDD consistently GPFs, make sure that Advantage is causing the GPF. Simply recompile the application without using any Advantage RDDs in any work area or data server. Then run the application to determine if the GPF still occurs.

If the problem persists, contact Advantage [Technical Support](master_technical_support_u_s__and_canada.htm).
