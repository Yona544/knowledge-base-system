Index keys are the individually sorted elements in an index order that reference a record in a table. What a record is to a table, a key is to an index. In other words, if an index order exists on the lastname field, and if record 69 in the table has the value "Smith" in the lastname field, then the index order would have a "Smith" key that references record 69.
