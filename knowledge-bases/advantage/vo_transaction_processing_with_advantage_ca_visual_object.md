The Advantage Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET RDDs support transaction processing (TPS). The function [AX\_Transaction()](vo_ax_transaction.htm) with one of the parameters AX\_BEGIN\_TRANSACTION, AX\_COMMIT\_TRANSACTION, or AX\_ROLLBACK\_TRANSACTION control TPS. AX\_Transaction() returns True if it is successful and False otherwise. If the argument is AX\_ISACTIVE\_TRANSACTION, the function returns True if a transaction is currently active. For a detailed description of the Advantage Transaction Processing System, see [Transaction Processing System](master_transaction_processing_system.htm).
