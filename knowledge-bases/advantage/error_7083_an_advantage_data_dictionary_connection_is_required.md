Problem 1: When connecting to the Advantage Database Server through an Internet connection, a 7083 error is returned and the connection fails.

Solution 1: The Advantage Data Dictionary contains user names, passwords, and other necessary information required for a secure connection over the Internet. All Internet connections require an Advantage Data Dictionary connection. In the connection path, specify the full path and file name of the Advantage Data Dictionary.

 

Problem 2: When connecting to the Advantage Database Server with a non-Internet connection, a 7083 error is returned and the connection fails. This error will occur if the Advantage Database Server has been configured to disallow free connections.

Solution 2: In the connection path, specify the full path and file name of the Advantage Data Dictionary, or turn off the DISABLE\_FREE\_CONNECTIONS configuration parameter.

 

Problem 3: Advantage Database Server failed to get a connection to the target database to perform a replication update. If this occurs, the error class will be 7600.

Solution 3: An Advantage Data Dictionary is required for performing replication updates. Edit the subscription and verify that the target database is a valid Advantage data dictionary.
