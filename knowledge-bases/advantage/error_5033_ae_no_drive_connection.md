No connected server was found for the given drive letter. This error may occur if the application's connect path to the database relies on a mapped drive letter. Verify that the workstation has the correct drive mapped to the server. For example, if the application's connect path is H:\data, verify that H:\ is mapped on the workstation. If using the Advantage Internet Server, add the appropriate drive letters to the [DRIVES] section of the ADS.INI file.
