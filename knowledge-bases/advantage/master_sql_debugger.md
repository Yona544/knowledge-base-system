The Advantage Data Architect (ARC) includes an SQL debugger that can be used to debug SQL scripts as well as database objects that use SQL, such as stored procedures, user defined functions and triggers.

The debugger allows you to set breakpoints, step through a script line by line, view variable data, callstack information, and other useful debugging information. The debugger can be used to find problems in existing SQL scripts, and can be very helpful when writing new scripts.

Full SQL debugger documentation can be found in the "SQL Debugger" book in the Advantage Data Architect help file.
