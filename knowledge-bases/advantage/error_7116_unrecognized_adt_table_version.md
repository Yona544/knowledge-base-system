Problem: The version number of the ADT (Advantage proprietary table) is not recognized by this version of the software. The table was either created by a newer version of Advantage, or it has been corrupted.

Solution: If the table was created with a newer version of Advantage, it will be necessary to use that version of Advantage to access the table. If the table was not created by a newer version of Advantage, run the ADT table repair utility (ADTFIX.EXE) against the offending ADT table. This utility is available for download from the Advantage Developer Zone Web site in the "Tools & Utilities" section, <http://DevZone.AdvantageDatabase.com>.
