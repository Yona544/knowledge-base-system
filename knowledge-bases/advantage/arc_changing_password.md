To change the password of the user you are currently logged in as, right-click the database icon in the tree view and select Change Password.

To change the password of other users select the user in question in the tree view, and then right-click and select Change Password.

Note You must have ALTER permissions for the specific user you wish to change the password of. By default any user can change their own password and ADSSYS can change any users password.
