Problem: An online pack operation was already active on a table when another online pack operation was requested on the same table.

Solution1: Allow the previous online pack operation to finish before attempting to pack the same table again.

Solution2: Cancel the active online pack operation before attempting to pack the same table again. Â Consider specifying a timeout value in the sp\_PackTableOnline call if the operation is taking too long.
