Problem 1: The auto-created ADT table cannot be opened from the command line or Windows Explorer using Advantage Data Architect.

Solution 1: Select File|Open Table and specify the path to the Advantage Data Dictionary the table is bound to. This error only affects Advantage Data Architect.

 

Problem 2: The file is not a valid Advantage Data Dictionary file.

Solution 2: Make sure the connect path specifies a directory instead of a file.

 

Problem 3: The specified data dictionary file is already opened by the Advantage Local Server and the Advantage Database Server is trying to open the same data dictionary.

Solution 3: Change the configuration of all users to use the same server type to connect to the data dictionary.

 

Problem 4: The specified data dictionary file is already opened by the Advantage Database Server and the Advantage Local Server is trying to open the same data dictionary.

Solution 4: Change the configuration of all users to use the same server type to connect to the data dictionary.

 

Problem 5: This error can occur when making a connection or opening a table from inside a server-side module (such as an extended procedure or a trigger) on a Windows server and using a drive letter. Services cannot resolve a drive letter to a local path, which can lead to a 7008 error.

Solution 5: Use UNC (\\SERVERNAME\SHARE) when making connections or opening tables from inside a server-side module. Also use UNC for any TDataSet aliases that are used from inside a server-side module.
