Problem: The memo file associated with this table is corrupt.

Solution: If you are using ADT tables, download the adtfix utility from the Advantage Developer Zone (devzone.advantagedatabase.com) and run the utility on the ADT table that logged this error. If you are using DBF tables, use a third-party DBF repair utility to repair the table and memo file.
