Problem: The attempted operation requires modifying encrypted records but the encryption password is not supplied.

Solution: Supply the encryption password before performing the operation.

Problem: An attempt was made to connect to a data dictionary [encrypted with AES](master_encryption.htm) without providing a dictionary password.

Solution: Provide the dictionary password either in the [SE\_Passwords](master_se_passwords.htm) server configuration parameter or the [DDPassword connection option](ace_adsconnect101.htm).

Problem: The server fails to start and logs a 7068 error. This may signify that [failed transaction log files](master_advantage_transaction_processing_system_features.htm) exist that are [encrypted with AES](master_encryption.htm).

Solution: Provide the dictionary password (or free table passwords) either in the [SE\_Passwords](master_se_passwords.htm) server configuration parameter or the equivalent /SEPasswords command line parameter.
