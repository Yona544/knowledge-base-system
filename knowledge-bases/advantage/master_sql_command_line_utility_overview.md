The SQL command line utility, asqlcmd.exe, can be used to execute a single SQL query or a batch of queries either interactively or from script files. The results from the query execution are printed to the standard output.The utility is installed with Advantage Database Server, ACE SDK and Advantage Data Architect. The utility can be started with various [Command Line Switches](master_sql_command_line_switches.htm) that control executing of queries and script. Once started, the utility supports a set of [commands](master_sql_command_line_supported_commands.htm) to control the subsequent operations.
