Go Top will position to the first record in the table if no index files are open, no index order is active, or no index order was specified in the Go Top operation. If an index order is active or is specified, then Go Top will position to the first logical record in the index order. For example, if the index order is on "name", a Go Top will position to the record containing the first "A" name in the table.
