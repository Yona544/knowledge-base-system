When Advantage is selected as the [table type](odbc_table_type.htm), the default extension used for tables is ADT, and the extension for created indexes is ADI. The ADI indexes created are auto-open. In this case, they are automatically selected and no additional Data Source setup is required.

When creating indexes, "tags" (similar to individual index files) are added to the auto-open index. If an auto-open index does not exist, one will be created and the tag will be inserted.
