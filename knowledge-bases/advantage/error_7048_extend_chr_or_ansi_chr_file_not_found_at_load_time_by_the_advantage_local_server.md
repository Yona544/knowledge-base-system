Problem: When the Advantage Local Server DLL was loaded, the EXTEND.CHR or ANSI.CHR file could not be found. The Advantage Local Server will not be available to the Advantage application.

Solution: Put the EXTEND.CHR or ANSI.CHR file somewhere in your client PC's search path (e.g., your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM) directory.
