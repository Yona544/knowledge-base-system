An application is scalable if only the single application is needed to access data in various environments. Advantage provides many scalability features and functions that are accessible from different development platforms.

With Advantage, functions and/or drivers are provided that allow a single application to open files that exist on the client workstation as well as files that exist on a file server. A single Advantage application can access data on a Windows server using the Advantage Database Server for Windows or a Linux server using the Advantage Database Server for Linux. The same single application can also communicate to the Advantage Database Server via either the IPX protocol or IP protocol, depending on which is available and supported.
