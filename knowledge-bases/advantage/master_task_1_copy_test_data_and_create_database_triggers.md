| Task 1: Copy Test Data and Create Database  Advantage Concepts |  |  |  |  |

This tutorial uses a simplified order-entry database, which can be found in the data\lantables directory of your installation (default is c:\Program Files\Advantage X.x\data\lantables). Copy the contents of this directory to a working directory, which will be referred to as c:\data throughout this tutorial.

Take a few moments to open the tables using the Advantage Data Architect (ARC) and become familiar with the tables and their contents.
