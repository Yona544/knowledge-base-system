Query logging is a feature that permits you to capture information about queries that are executed by your client applications. This information can be used to identify bottlenecks in your applications, helping you to better focus your attention on trouble areas in your applications.

Query logging can be easily enabled and disabled without affecting running client applications. Query logging can also be enabled only for queries that are non-optimized or for those that take a relatively long time to execute. Query logging is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.
