Problem: Some records in the table are already encrypted using an encryption method that is not supported by this version of the Advantage Database Server. Thus, the Advantage Database Server was unable to enable encryption on this table.

Solution: The table must be decrypted using the version of the Advantage Database Server and the Advantage client that encrypted the records in the table originally.
