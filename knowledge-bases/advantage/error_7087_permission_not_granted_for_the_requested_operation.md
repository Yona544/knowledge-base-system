Problem: An operation on a database table failed because it requires permission not granted to the user performing the operation. Some of the possible causes are:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 路 | Attempting to update an existing row in the table but the UPDATE permission was not granted on the table or not granted on some columns to be modified, |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 路 | Attempting to insert a new row in the table but the INSERT permission was not granted on the table |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 路 | Attempting to delete a row in a table but the DELETE permission was not granted on the table |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 路 | Attempting to set a filter or scope on a table but the filter expression or the scope index contains columns that the user has no READ permission |

Solution: If the requested operation is necessary, the database administrator must grant the user the appropriate permission.

Problem: An attempt to open a [free table](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_1731427715,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)) failed because access to [free table](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_1731427715,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)) is restricted on this [database connection](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_465551922,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)).

Solution: If the requested operation is necessary, the application must not set the CheckFreeTableAccess option to true when connecting to the data dictionary.
