Advantage supports a number of different scalar functions that can be used within SQL statements and in navigational usage (e.g., in direct table filters and index expressions). For historical reasons and because of slight semantic differences and keyword conflicts, not all scalar functions can be used in each of those two environments. But many scalars can be used both in [index expressions](master_indexes_with_expressions.htm) and in SQL statements. The documentation for each scalar indicates where it is supported. The following types of scalars are supported:

[Math Functions](master_math_functions.htm)

[String Functions](master_string_functions.htm)

[Date/Time Functions](master_date_time_functions.htm)

[Miscellaneous Functions](master_miscellaneous_functions.htm)
