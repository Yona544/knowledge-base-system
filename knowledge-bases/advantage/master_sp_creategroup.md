Remarks

sp\_CreateGroup creates a user group object in the database. A user group can be used to logically group users with similar object access rights together. By default, a user inherits rights from the groups that he is a member of. By granting rights to user groups instead of users, it makes it simpler to add and remove access rights to multiple users. A user can become a member of a user group by calling the sp\_AddUserToGroup.

Note When a database is created, it does not perform access rights checking by default. In order to enforce the access rights of the users, the VERIFY\_ACCESS\_RIGHTS property of the database must be set to True by calling the [sp\_ModifyDatabase](master_sp_modifydatabase.htm).

Example

After making a connection to the database, create a user group named "Managers" in the database and grant the user group read and update permissions to the "Employees" table.

EXECUTE PROCEDURE sp\_CreateGroup(

Managers,

All managers are in this group. );

Â 

GRANT SELECT,UPDATE ON Employees To Managers;
