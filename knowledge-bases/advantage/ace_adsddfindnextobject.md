Syntax

UNSIGNED32 AdsDDFindNextObject( ADSHANDLE hDBConn,

ADSHANDLE hFindHandle,

UNSIGNED8 \*pucObjectName,

UNSIGNED16 \*pusObjectNameLen );

Parameters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| hDBConn (I) | Handle of a [database connection](javascript:hhpopuplink.TextPopup(popid_465551922,FontFace,-1,-1,-1,-1)). |
| hFindHandle (I) | Find handle that was returned by [AdsDDFindFirstObject](ace_adsddfindfirstobject.htm). |
| pucObjectName (O) | Returns the name of next object in the data dictionary. The length of the object name has a maximum length of ADS\_MAX\_OBJECT\_NAME\_LEN. |
| pusObjectNameLen (I/O) | On input, specifies the size of the buffer pointed to by the pucObjectName. On output, returns the length of the object name returned in pucObjectName. |

Special Return Codes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| AE\_NO\_OBJECT\_FOUND | No additional object matching the specified condition was found in the data dictionary. |

Remarks

AdsDDFindNextObject is used in conjunction with [AdsDDFindFirstObject](ace_adsddfindfirstobject.htm) to retrieve the names of the objects matching the search condition from the data dictionary. When names of all objects matching the searching condition have been retrieved, the function returns AE\_NO\_OBJECT\_FOUND.

See [AdsDDFindFirstObject](ace_adsddfindfirstobject.htm) for information on types of objects that can be searched.

Example

Find all index files that are associated with the "Customer Information" table.

AdsConnect60( "n:\\MyData\\myData.ADD", ADS\_REMOTE\_SERVER, "ADSSYS", NULL, ADS\_DEFAULT, &hDD );

usBufferSize = (UNSIGNED16)sizeof( aucFileName );

if ( AE\_SUCCESS == AdsDDFindFirstObject( hDD, ADS\_DD\_INDEX\_FILE\_OBJECT,

"Customer Information", aucFileName,

&usBufferSize, &hFindHandle ))

{

do

{

printf( "%s\n", aucFileName );

usBufferSize = (UNSIGNED16)sizeof( aucFileName );

}

while ( AE\_SUCCESS == AdsDDFindNextObject( hDD, hFindHandle, aucFileName, &usBufferSize ));

}

Â 

/\* No need to call AdsDDFindClose since we are closing the DD. \*/

AdsDisconnect( hDD );
