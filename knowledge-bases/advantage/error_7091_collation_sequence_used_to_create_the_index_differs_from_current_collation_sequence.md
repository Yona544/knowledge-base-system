Problem: Advantage detected a mismatch between the collation sequence used to create the index file and the current collation sequence.

Solution: See error code [5175](error_5175_ae_index_collation_mismatch.htm) for more information about this error. The 7091 error is only written to the error log. If you are using a client that is version 6.2 or greater, the client will also detect the mismatch and return a 5175 error.
