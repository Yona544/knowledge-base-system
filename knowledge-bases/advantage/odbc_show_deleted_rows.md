In DBF files, deleted rows are marked for deletion, but are not physically removed. By default, deleted rows will not be displayed. However, if you prefer to see all rows in the database tables, select this option. When using the Advantage proprietary table type, deleted rows are never visible. Deleted rows can be removed with the system procedure [sp\_PackTable](master_sp_packtable.htm).
