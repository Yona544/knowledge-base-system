Problem: The database administrator currently has logins on this database disabled.

Solution: Login at a different time or contact your administrator.

Problem: A [database CONNECT trigger](master_database_triggers.htm), prevented the login attempt either because it threw an exception or intentionally logged an error to prevent the login.

Solution: Login as ADSSYS or contact your administrator.
