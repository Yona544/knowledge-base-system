Problem: A Copy To or Append From operation was attempted with tables located on different servers. The Copy To or Append From operation will not be performed on the server.

Solution: If you want the Copy To or Append From operation to be performed on the server by the Advantage Database Server, make sure and specify tables that are located on the same file server on which the Advantage Database Server is running.
