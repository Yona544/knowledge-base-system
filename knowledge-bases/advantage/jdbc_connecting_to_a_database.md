Once the driver is installed, you can connect from your application to the Advantage Database Server with a connection URL through the JDBC driver manager. This quick start explains how to establish your connection using a connection URL.

You can connect through the JDBC driver manager with the method DriverManager.getConnection. This method uses a string containing a URL. Use the following steps to load the driver from your JDBC application:

[Setting the Classpath](jdbc_setting_the_classpath.htm)

[Registering the Driver](jdbc_registering_the_driver.htm)

[Passing the Connection URL](jdbc_passing_the_connection_url.htm)
