Problem: An error occurred in the Advantage Expression Engine parser. The internal stack has exceeded the maximum number of operators.

Solution: This is most likely due to the index key expression containing an unusually high number of operators. Contact Advantage [Technical Support](master_technical_support_u_s__and_canada.htm).
