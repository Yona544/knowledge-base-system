Note to Advantage TDataSet Descendant users: If you are writing a multi-threaded application (for example, a Web application) it is possible to get this error if you have not uniquely named each TAdsConnection component. For further explanation and an example see the topic, Building Multi-Threaded Applications with TAdsQuery and TAdsTable in the Advantage TDataSet Descendant Help documentation (ADE.HLP).
