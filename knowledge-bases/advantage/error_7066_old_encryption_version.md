Problem: Either the encryption algorithm used to encrypt data in this table used an old and obsolete algorithm, or the Advantage client is attempting to use old and obsolete encryption APIs.

Solution: Either convert your tables to have encrypted data via the latest encryption algorithm, or upgrade your Advantage client software to the version that uses the latest encryption technology.
