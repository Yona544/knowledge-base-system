Database logins can be disabled for all users (except the ADSSYS user). This can be helpful if you are performing some sort of database maintenance in which you do not want users to connect to the database. See [Disabling Database Logins](master_disabling_database_logins.htm) for specific details.

To disable database logins:

|  |  |

| 2. | Select disable logins from the quick-menu. The Login Control dialog will be shown. |

| 3. | Select the Logins are Disabled radio button and specify any custom error code information youd like to return to clients that attempt connections while logins are disabled. |

|  |  |

| 4. | Click OK. |
