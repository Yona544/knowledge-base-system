If you have non-Advantage applications that need access to your database, and you cannot convert those applications to use Advantage, you will likely be limited to using the Xbase file format. If you are using report generating software and that software does not use a native Advantage client, nor does it have the ability to access data via an ODBC driver, that report generator will be unable to use the Advantage proprietary file format. In this scenario, you could either use the Xbase file format or use a different report generating software that can use Advantage.
