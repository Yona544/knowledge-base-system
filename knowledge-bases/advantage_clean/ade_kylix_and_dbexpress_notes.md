Although a dbExpress driver may be provided in the future, the recommended (and much simpler) programming approach is to use the Advantage TDataSet Descendant.

Delphi technologies (even those that rely heavily on dbExpress technology, like DataSnap) almost always support any TDataSet descendant. A DataSnap project can be developed using dbExpress as the transport, but still using the Advantage TDataSet Descendant for data access.
