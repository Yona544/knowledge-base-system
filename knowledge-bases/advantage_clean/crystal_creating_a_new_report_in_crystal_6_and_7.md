Note: Crystal Reports versions 6 through 8 are no longer supported. The following help topic has been left in place as a courtesy for those that are still working with these unsupported versions.

To create a new report that uses the Advantage Crystal Reports driver:

| 1. | Create a new report as you normally would with Crystal. |

| 2. | When prompted to select the data you will be reporting on, choose the 'SQL/ODBC' button. All Advantage alias entries will be shown in the list in the format: |

'Advantage SQL - AliasName'

| 3. | If you have never configured an Advantage alias, see [Defining a Database Alias for use with Crystal Reports](crystal_defining_a_database_alias_for_use_with_crystal_reports.md) for a description and example ads.ini file. Select the desired Advantage entry in the list and continue developing the report. This is the only Advantage-specific selection you will have to make. |
