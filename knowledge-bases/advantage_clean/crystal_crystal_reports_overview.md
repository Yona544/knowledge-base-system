The Advantage Crystal Reports Driver provides developers with a native interface to the Advantage Database Server and Advantage Local Server for the Crystal Reports reporting tool.

The Advantage Crystal Reports Driver should be used by developers who do not want to use ODBC or OLE DB for data access in their reports. The Advantage Crystal Reports Driver does not provide any performance enhancements over ODBC or OLE DB access. It does, however, provide an interface that does not require ODBC or OLE DB setup on each individual computer that will be running a report.

The Advantage Crystal Reports Driver utilizes the Advantage SQL engine to provide access to Clipper-compatible DBF tables (via an Advantage Data Dictionary), FoxPro-compatible DBF tables and Advantage proprietary ADT tables. The Advantage Crystal Reports Driver offers ODBC and OLE DB-free access to the Advantage Database Server and Advantage Local Server through Crystal Reports and moves all SQL processing to the server when using the Advantage Database Server.
