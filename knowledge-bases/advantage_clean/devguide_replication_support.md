Replication ensures that changes made to one database are reliably propagated to another. While the destination database may be on the same machine as the source, more than likely it will be on another server on the network or the Internet.

Replication is only available with ADS, and requires an additional replication license in addition to the regular ADS license. Replication is discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
