There are three Advantage server types available for accessing data: Remote Server which is the Advantage Database Server, Local Server which is the Advantage Local Server, and Internet Server which accesses the Advantage Database Server through an Internet connection. By default, the Advantage ODBC Driver will access Remote Server and Internet Server. To control access to server types, check the appropriate box in the Available Server Types section of the Advantage ODBC Driver Setup screen. The Advantage ODBC Driver will attempt connections to the checked server types in the following priority if more than one server type is selected: Remote Server, Internet Server, and then Local Server.
