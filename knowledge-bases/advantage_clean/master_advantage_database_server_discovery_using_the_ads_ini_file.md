The Advantage Database Server can be "discovered" by specifying an IP address and port in the [ADS.INI File](master_ads_ini_file_support.md).The Advantage communication layer reads the IP address and port from the ADS.INI file. When an IP address and port are specified, no other types of discovery are used. This method of discovery requires the Advantage Database Server to have a static IP address and port. The Advantage connection information is then sent to the Advantage Database Server at this IP address and port.

See [IP Port](master_ip_port.md) for more information.
