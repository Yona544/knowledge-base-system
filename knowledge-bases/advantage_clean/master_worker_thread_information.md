Advantage Database Server Worker Threads perform the actual database operations on the server. "Worker Thread Information" displays the current number of Worker Threads being used, the maximum number of Worker Threads used at any one time, and the configured number of Worker Threads. If the Max Used value is equal to the Configured value, you may want to increase the "[Number of Worker Threads](master_number_of_worker_threads_t_.md)" setting to increase overall Advantage Database Server throughput.
