The Advantage Data Architect (ARC32.EXE) is a tool for developing and maintaining databases and database applications. It may also be used for testing Advantage functionality. The application ships with source code for example purposes. The Advantage Data Architect product can be downloaded from the Downloads page on the Advantage Database Server Web site, www.AdvantageDatabase.com.

Listed below are some of the features available with the Advantage Data Architect:

- Complete data management functionality such as table creation, restructuring, indexing, packing, etc.

- Importing and converting other table types such as Paradox, Access, and SQL Server tables.

- Testing filter expressions to determine the level at which they will be optimized.

- Testing Advantage SQL engine queries.

- Testing ODBC SQL queries.

- Environment checking which can be used to test and diagnose connection issues with the Advantage Database Server.

- Checking server activity with the built in Advantage Management utility. With this functionality, you can verify that files are actually opened by the Advantage Database Server. You can also remotely determine which index files are opened, which users are connected, what installation parameters where selected, what files or records are locked, and how many transactions are in progress.

- Creating aliases. An alias configuration utility is included in the Advantage Data Architect. This functionality in ARC allows you to set up aliases similar to Delphi database aliases.

- Creating queries using a built in visual query designer.
