We want to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to everyone who made this book possible. We are indebted to the wonderful people at Sybase iAnywhere. In particular, we want to thank Chuck Vertrees, Advantage Product Manager, for inspiring this project and promoting it at Sybase iAnywhere; and Jill Cryder, Advantage Marketing Manager, for all of her dedication and hard work.

We are also deeply indebted to, and grateful for, the technical editing team, who gave us hands-down the best technical edit and support that we have ever had on a book. This team was lead by this book's Technical Editor J.D. Mullin. During the course of this book, not only did J.D., the Advantage R&D Project Manager, meticulously review each of these chapters, but he also had each chapter reviewed by several, and sometimes all, of the following people (listed in alphabetical order): Chris Franz, Peter Funk, Ben Magazino, Lance Schmidt, Chuck Vertrees, Mark Wilkins, and Alex Wong. We also want to thank Brad Schmidt, who was lead technical editor on our last Advantage book. His input is evident in this work.

In addition, we appreciate the unflinching help of Lance, J.D., Chris, and Alex for their advice and input on writing the applications that appear in Part 3 of this book. Other people at Sybase iAnywhere that we want to thank include Edgar Sherman, Joachim Dürr, Dirk Erickson, Phil Ruebel, Bryce Twitchell, and Jay Wendt. We also want to thank the many new friends that we've met at Sybase and at Sybase iAnywhere who helped make this book a reality

We also want to express our gratitude to our favorite copy editor, Dennis Weaver. Dennis, who is now a top-producing realtor in the Phoenix/Scottsdale market, agreed to come out of copyediting retirement to perform his magic on this book.

Finally, we want to express our thanks to the many wonderful people who use and champion the Advantage Database Server. This is a really great community, and your enthusiasm for this product is nothing less than contagious.
