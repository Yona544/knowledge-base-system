Every AEP has a pre-defined function prototype:

function NameOfAEP( ulConnectionID: UNSIGNED32;

hConnection: ADSHANDLE;

pulNumRowsAffected: PUNSIGNED32 ): UNSIGNED32;

begin

Â 

end;

Each parameter is described in detail in the general [Advantage Extended Procedures](master_advantage_extended_procedures.md) documentation. We wont describe each parameter here; well address these parameters as they are used throughout the rest of the tutorial.

The AEP template that was created for you already contains one procedure entrypoint, MyProcedure. We will enhance this existing procedure in later sections.
