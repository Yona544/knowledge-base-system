Problem: An attempt to load a [dynamic collation](master_collation_support.md) failed because the version of the collation was not recognized.

Solution: Verify that the correct collation was specified. If the version is newer than what Advantage recognizes and the collation repository is valid, then it is necessary to use a newer version of Advantage.
