Problem: An error occurred opening the Advantage semaphore connection file. When an Advantage application first connects to the Advantage Database Server, it attempts to open a semaphore connection file. This open failed.

Solution: By default, the semaphore connection file exists in the same directory as the first table opened. If the user does not have network READ privileges in this directory, the semaphore connection file cannot be opened and the user cannot connect to the Advantage server. The application must either open its first table in a directory where the user has network READ privileges or a non-default semaphore connection file path must be set up. See the Semaphore Connection File Path description in the Configuration chapter in your Advantage Database Server Guide for information on setting up a semaphore connection file path.
