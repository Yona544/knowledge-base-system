While database servers themselves are nonvisual service applications, many databases provide you with some type of GUI utility for creating, configuring, and managing your databases. With Advantage, this utility is called the Advantage Data Architect.

With the release of Advantage 8, the Advantage Data Architect has received its first complete rewrite since it was originally released. The updated look can be seen in Figure 1-13, which shows an open database with an open table from the main screen of the updated Advantage Data Architect.
