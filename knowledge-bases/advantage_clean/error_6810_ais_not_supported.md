Problem: Version 6.0 of the Advantage client does not support the Advantage Internet Server.

Solution: The Advantage Internet Server can be used with any Advantage client versions older than v6.0. Therefore, if you require use of the Advantage Internet Server with the Advantage Database Server v6.0, you must use a version of an Advantage client older than version 6.0. Version 6.1 of the Advantage Database Server will incorporate the Advantage Internet Server into the database server. This will allow version 6.1 or greater of the Advantage Database Server to have Internet support without the need for a separate Advantage Internet Server product and will provide support for versions 6.1 or greater of any Advantage client.
