[TAdsConnection](ade_tadsconnection_7.md)

Aborts all of the database updates, inserts, and deletes sent to the server since the transaction began.

Syntax

procedure Rollback;

procedure Rollback( strSavepoint: string );

Description

Call this function to abort the database updates, inserts, and deletes made during the transaction. If a savepoint is specified, the transaction is rolled back to that savepiont. When using [nested transactions](master_nesting_transactions.md), calling Rollback without a savepoint name rolls back all work to the outermost begin transaction operation and ends the transaction.

This method is ignored if the connection is using Advantage Local Server. See [Advantage Transaction Processing](master_transaction_processing_system.md) for more information.
