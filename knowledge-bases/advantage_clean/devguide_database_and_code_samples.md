The examples described throughout this book use a sample Advantage database. This database includes table, index, and memo files.

This database does not include a data dictionary, nor does it include a number of other objects, such as additional tables, index orders, constraints, users, groups, referential integrity definitions, stored procedures, triggers, publications, and subscriptions that are used in the examples described in this book. You will create these objects as you work through the various step-by-step instructions provided throughout.

In all cases, we have tried to make the creation of these additional objects easy for you. The additional tables, index orders, constraints, users, groups, and referential integrity definitions are relatively simple, and detailed instructions for creating these objects are provided in Part I.

Furthermore, not only do we provide you with the step-by-step instructions for creating stored procedures and triggers, but we also provide code in text files for the code listings that appear in Chapters 7 and 8, so that you do not have to type in all of the code while working with the examples in these chapters. The files are referred to in these chapters and follow the naming conventions of listing7-1.txt, listing7-2.txt, and so on.

There are also four script files, ch7procedure.sql, ch8triggers.sql, ch12queries.sql, and ch13queries.sql, which contain SQL query examples for Chapters 7, 8, 12, and 13, respectively. Again, these are provided so that you do not have to enter all of the SQL code while working through the examples.

In addition, the sample applications described in Chapters 1519 are found in the same compressed file that contains the sample database. See the appropriate chapter for the names of these files.

   
NOTE: If you try to install the code samples and find that there is a problem, please download the sample database and code samples from this book's Web site, as described at the end of this appendix.
