Before we add tables to a data dictionary, it makes sense to learn how to open a closed connection in the Advantage Data Architect.

1.        If DemoDictionary is still open in the Advantage Data Architect, right-click this connection and select Disconnect.

| 2. | Now, double-click on the DemoDictionary connection in the Connection Repository. The Advantage Data Architect responds by opening the connection. (If you did not have the Blank Password property of the connection set to Yes, the Advantage Data Architect would have challenged for a user name and password before opening the connection). Select Disconnect again and this time, click the + sign next to the DemoDictionary connection. This is a second method for opening a connection. |
