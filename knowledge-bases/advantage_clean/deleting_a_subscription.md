To delete a Subscription, open a database. See [Opening a Database](arc_opening_a_database2.md) for details. You must login to the database as a user with DROP permissions on the specific subscription in order to delete a subscription from a database. From the tree view within the Connection Repository, right-click the Subscription's name icon and select Delete.
