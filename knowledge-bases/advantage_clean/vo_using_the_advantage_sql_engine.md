Advantage Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET RDD

| Using the Advantage SQL Engine  Advantage Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET RDD |  |  |  |  |

There are three methods to use the Advantage SQL engine with Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET. The most native way is using the AXSQL RDDs which provide a DBServer interface to SQL result sets. See [Using the Advantage AXSQL RDDs book](vo_introduction.md) for more information. The second method is using the Advantage Client Engine to make direct API calls or through the Advantage OLE DB Provider. The third method is using third-party products such as Vo2Ado which provides a class library that allows Visual Objects developers to use Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) in their applications. For more information about Vo2Ado, see http://www.sas-software.nl
