Â 

public void LockRecord(int iRecordNumber);

Remarks

A record lock allows a user to update a shared file. If a record lock is successful, the record is reread. If the given iRecordNumber is zero, the current record is locked. If the record number sent to this function is the number of records in the table + 1, no other users will be able to append records to the table.

Note This function does not perform multiple attempts to lock the record if the lock fails.
