Problem: The server was unable to stage a backup and get a logic snapshot. The backup continued, but with the chance that other worker threads could have changed data and made this a logically inconsistent backup.

Solution: To resolve this issue, run the backup again.

If the error persists, contact Advantage Technical Services. Configuration values exist that can be used to extend the period of time the server will wait before continuing.
