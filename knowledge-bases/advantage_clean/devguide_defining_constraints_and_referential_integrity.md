Constraints are data dictionarybased rules that Advantage can use to validate your data as it is being posted to a table. Referential integrity is a special type of constraint that ensures the data residing in two or more related tables remains consistent.

This chapter provides you with a broad overview of constraints and referential integrity. It begins with a discussion of data validation in your applications. It then shows you how to improve the integrity of your data using constraints and referential integrity.
