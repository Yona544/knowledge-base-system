Â 

property AdsTableOptions.AdsCharType;

Description

Type of character set used to store data in the table. Options are ANSI and OEM. For compatibility with DOS-based CA-Clipper applications, OEM should be specified. The OEM setting has no effect on Advantage proprietary ADT tables, which always use the ANSI setting.

In addition to the ANSI and OEM values, this can also be set to one of the [dynamic collation](master_collation_support.md) languages such as GENERAL\_VFP\_CI\_AS\_1252.
