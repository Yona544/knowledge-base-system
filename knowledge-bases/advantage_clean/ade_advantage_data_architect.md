Advantage Data Architect (ARC32.EXE) is a fully integrated tool to assist you in efficiently developing and maintaining Advantage database applications. Advantage Data Architect is free of charge and ships with source code. The Advantage Data Architect product can be downloaded from the Downloads page on the Advantage Developer's Zone Web site, <http://DevZone.AdvantageDatabase.com>.

While developing your database applications, the Advantage Data Architect allows you to:

- Import and convert other table types such as Paradox, dBASE, Access, and SQL Server tables to Advantage ADT tables.

- Create Advantage data dictionaries and define Referential Integrity rules, record and field level constraints, etc.

- Create tables and indexes.

- Generate and test Advantage SQL queries using a visual query designer.

- Generate code to automatically create tables and indexes using the Advantage Tables to Code Generator.

When setting up your database application, Advantage Data Architect allows you to:

- Check the client workstations environment to test and diagnose connection issues with the Advantage Database Server.

- Setup Access Control Lists to define user access rights for users who wish to connect to the Advantage Database Server.

- Create aliases similar to those used by the Borland Database Engine via the Connection Repository.

After the application is up and running, Advantage Data Architect allows you to:

- Manage the database with functionality for rebuilding indexes, packing tables, restructuring tables, and repairing tables.

- Manage Advantage data dictionaries with the Advantage Database Manager.

- Observe Advantage Database Server activity with the Advantage Management Utility, which includes verifying files are actually opened by the Advantage Database Server and determining which index files are opened, which users are connected, what installation parameters where selected, and what files or records are locked.
