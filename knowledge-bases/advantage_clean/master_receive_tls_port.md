Default = 0, which means that Advantage Database Server should attempt to bind to the default TLS port of 6263.

The RECEIVE\_TLS\_PORT configuration parameter can be used to specify which port number to use for Transport Layer Security (TLS) communications. See [Communications Encryption](master_communications_encryption.md) for more details.
