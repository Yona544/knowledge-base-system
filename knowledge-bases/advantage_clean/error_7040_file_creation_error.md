Problem: An error occurred when attempting to create a table or an index file.

Solution: Verify the directory where the file is to be created is accurate and exists. If the file already exists, verify no other users currently have the specified file open. Make sure the user has sufficient access rights to create and open the specified file (if using Advantage "check rights" security with free tables).
