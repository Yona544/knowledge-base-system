Advantage JDBC driver JAR file (adsjdbc.jar) includes a template dialect to support the Hibernate object-relation mapping (ORM) model. It is intended as a starting point for future enhancement as needs arise. The template dialect can be referenced at

org\hibernate\dialect\ADSDialect

The template dialect works in basic ORM setup. If you find more complex situations that require features not available in the template dialect, please contact Advantage technical services team so they can be considered for implementation.
