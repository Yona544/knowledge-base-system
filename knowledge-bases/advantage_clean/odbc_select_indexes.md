If existing compact IDX, or auto-open CDX or ADI indexes are to be used with the tables in the selected Database Directory, you must use "Select Indexes" to associate indexes with tables.

First, highlight a table from "Select Table". Then, select the indexes that are to be correlated to the highlighted table. You may select any number of indexes to be used with each table. The indexes displayed in the list are all index files found in the Database Directory.
