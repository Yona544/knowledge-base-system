Problem: Advantage Database Server was unable to dynamically load the Advantage Client Engine on startup. This error is never returned to a client application; it is only logged to the Advantage error log. When Advantage Database Server starts, it attempts to load the Advantage Client Engine, which is required for replication. Advantage will be unable to replicate data to target database if this occurs. If replication is enabled, however, the updates will be stored in the replication queue and will be processed when Advantage is restarted with the Advantage Client Engine available.

Solution: Make sure that the necessary library files are available to Advantage Database Server. In Windows environments, make sure the latest versions of ACE32.DLL and AXCWS32.DLL are available. In Linux, make sure the latest libace.so.X.YY.Z is available. You will need to stop and restart Advantage Database Server in order to load the Advantage client library.
