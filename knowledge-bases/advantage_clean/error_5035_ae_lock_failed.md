The requested lock could not be granted.

- The file or record may be locked by another user.

- When using the Advantage proprietary table type (ADTs) and the current record has been deleted.

- The record may have been modified within a transaction and the transaction has no been committed or rolled back. See [Advantage Transaction Processing System Limitations](master_advantage_transaction_processing_system_limitations.md).

Linux Note If using a pre-2.4 kernel, it is possible to get this error because of an incorrect lock offset range. See [USE\_LOW\_LOCK\_OFFSETS](master_advantage_local_server_configuration.md) for more details.
