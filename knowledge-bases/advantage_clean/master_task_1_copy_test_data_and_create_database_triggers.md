This tutorial uses a simplified order-entry database, which can be found in the data\lantables directory of your installation (default is c:\Program Files\Advantage X.x\data\lantables). Copy the contents of this directory to a working directory, which will be referred to as c:\data throughout this tutorial.

Take a few moments to open the tables using the Advantage Data Architect (ARC) and become familiar with the tables and their contents.

Create a New Database

| 1. | Open ARC and select Database -> New Database from the main menu. |

| 2. | Enter "trig\_tutorial" as the database name. |

| 3. | Enter "c:\data" as the database path. |

| 4. | Click the OK button. |

| 5. | When prompted to set the ADSSYS password click the NO button. |

| 6. | Click the OK button when the default database contents are explained. |

| 7. | Right-click the tables tree item and select Add existing table(s). |

| 8. | Hit ctrl-A to select all tables in the directory. |

| 9. | Click the Open button. All tables are now part of the database. |
