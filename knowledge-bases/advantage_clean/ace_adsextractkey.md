# Ace Adsextractkey

AdsExtractKey

AdsExtractKey

Advantage Client Engine

| AdsExtractKey  Advantage Client Engine |  |  |  |  |

Retrieves key data for the given index order for the current record.

Syntax

| UNSIGNED32 | AdsExtractKey (ADSHANDLE hIndex,  UNSIGNED8 \*pucKey,  UNSIGNED16 \*pusLen); |

Parameters

| hIndex (I) | Handle of index order. |
| pucKey (O) | Return key in this buffer. |
| pusLen (I/O) | Length of given buffer on input, length of returned data on output. |

Special Return Codes

| AE\_NOT\_FOUND | The desired index key was not found. It may not exist. |

Remarks

AdsExtractKey returns the binary data into the character buffer, and if the key is not of character type it is up to the user to convert the data to a usable state. It is important to note that the key generated by this function is built on the client, and the key may not exist in the index. The data from AdsExtractKey can be used directly in a subsequent call to [AdsSeek](ace_adsseek.md), [AdsSeekLast](ace_adsseeklast.md), or [AdsSetScope](ace_adssetscope.md). If used in this way, the usDataType parameter of those APIs should be passed as ADS\_RAWKEY so that no conversions are performed on the key.
