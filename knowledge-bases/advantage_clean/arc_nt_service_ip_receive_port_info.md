Default = next available IP Port

By default, the Advantage Database Server will secure the next IP port available at startup time for use later to receive data via the IP protocol from Advantage clients. If you desire the Advantage Database Server to use a specific IP port, rather than the next available, then edit this setting. The NETSTAT utility with the option "-a" (i.e., "netstate -a") can be used to find out what IP ports are currently in use.
