To delete a stored procedure, open a database. See [Opening a Database](arc_opening_a_database2.md) for details. You must login to the database as a user with DROP permissions on the specific procedure in order to delete a stored procedure from a database. From the tree view within the Connection Repository, right-click the Procedure's name icon and select Delete. Deleting the Advantage Extended Procedure will remove it from the Database, but it will not delete the .AEP container file.
