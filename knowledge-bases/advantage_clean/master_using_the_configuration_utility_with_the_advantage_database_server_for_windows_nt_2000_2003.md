The Advantage Database Server for Windows stores configuration information in the Windows registry. The Advantage Database Server configuration key and values are viewable and editable via the Configuration Utility, which appears as a tab within the [Advantage Configuration Utility for Windows](master_advantage_configuration_utility_for_windows_nt_2000_2003.md). There are four configuration tabs within the Configuration Utility tab in which configuration parameter information appears: Database Settings, File Locations, Communications, and Miscellaneous Settings.

Note Changes to any of the configuration values will not affect the Advantage Database Server Service until you stop and re-start the Advantage Database Server Service.
