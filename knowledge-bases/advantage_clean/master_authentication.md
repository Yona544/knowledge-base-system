| Authentication  Advantage Database Server |  |  |  |  |

Advantage Database Server uses a handshaking sequence for authentication. During authentication, a unique electronic signature (or certificate) is generated by both Advantage Database Server and the connecting client. This electronic signature is then evaluated and authentication is granted or denied on the basis of the signature from both sides being valid. All data is encrypted during authentication. The password is never sent out over the wire in any form.
