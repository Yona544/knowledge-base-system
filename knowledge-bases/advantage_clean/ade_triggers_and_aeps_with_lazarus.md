After installing the TDataSet Descendant (or the source tarball for [Linux](ade_using_lazarus_on_linux.md)), the TDataSet installation directory will contain two subdirectories, with template projects for an Advantage Trigger and an Advantage Extended Procedure (AEP) that can be built in Lazarus. Â Copy these folders into the Lazarus Template Directory (configured in Lazarus in the "Tools", "Project Templates Options" menu) and restart Lazarus.

A new Trigger or Advantage Extended Procedure project can be created from either the "Project", "New Project" or "File", "New Project From Template..." menu.
