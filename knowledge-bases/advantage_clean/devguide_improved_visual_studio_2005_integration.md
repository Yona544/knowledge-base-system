While you can develop .NET application using a number of different languages and IDEs, Visual Studio 2005 is the most popular IDE for .NET development. Fortunately, Advantage includes a number of important enhancements specifically for this environment.

With Advantage 8.1 you can now add data connections to the Server Explorer using the Advantage .NET Data Provider. Adding an Advantage data connection to the Server Explorer permits you to easily view your database's metadata from within Visual Studio, include the names of tables, views, and stored procedures, as well as field and parameter names and data types.

Advantage also provides support for creating TableAdapters for strongly typed Advantage datasets. To do this, you use the Visual Studio TableAdapter Configuration Wizard.
