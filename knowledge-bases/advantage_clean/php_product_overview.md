Advantage PHP Extension

| Product Overview  Advantage PHP Extension |  |  |  |  |

The Advantage PHP Extension is a programming tool developed specifically to provide data access to the Advantage Database Server using the [Advantage SQL Engine](master_advantage_sql_engine.md). Using the Advantage PHP Extension you can develop high-speed, dynamically generated Web sites or create HTML reports.

The Advantage PHP Extension ties in seamlessly with the [Advantage Database Server](master_advantage_database_server.md) or [Advantage Internet Server](master_advantage_internet_server_overview.md) to provide a true client/server solution. The combination of Advantage Database Server and the Advantage PHP Extension allows developers to create Web sites that are extremely stable and responsive. An Advantage Internet Connector license will likely be needed if using the Advantage Database Server with a web server. An Internet Connector license is available from your Advantage Sales representative or Advantage distributor.
