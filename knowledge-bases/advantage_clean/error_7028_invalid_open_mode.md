Problem: A data or index file was attempted to be opened in a different Advantage Locking mode than it was originally opened. Advantage Locking modes cannot be mixed.

Solution: Check that you are not trying to mix Advantage Locking modes on the data or index file in question. Correct the problem by using the same Advantage Locking mode.
