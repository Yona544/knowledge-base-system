Problem 5: This error can occur when making a connection or opening a table from inside a server-side module (such as an extended procedure or a trigger) on a Windows server and using a drive letter. Services cannot resolve a drive letter to a local path, which can lead to a 7008 error.

Solution 5: Use UNC (\\SERVERNAME\SHARE) when making connections or opening tables from inside a server-side module. Also use UNC for any TDataSet aliases that are used from inside a server-side module.
