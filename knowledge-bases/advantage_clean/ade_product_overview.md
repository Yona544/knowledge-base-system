Advantage TDataSet Descendant

| Product Overview  Advantage TDataSet Descendant |  |  |  |  |

The Advantage TDataSet Descendant is a programming tool developed specifically to provide native data access to the Advantage Database Server or Advantage Local Server. Using the Advantage TDataSet Descendant, you can develop programs as you always have using standard TTable and TQuery methods and properties. The Advantage TDataSet Descendant native component solutions offer the flexibility of scaling from non-networked to unlimited users without changing a line of code or re-compiling your application.

The Advantage TDataSet Descendant ties in seamlessly with the [Advantage Database Server](master_advantage_database_server.md), a true client/server solution that adds performance and stability to multi-user applications. The [Advantage Local Server](master_advantage_local_server.md), a non-client/server solution for accessing data located on computers that are not running the Advantage Database Server, provides a smaller memory and distribution footprint than the BDE (several 100K versus over 2Mg for the BDE), as well as improved and added functionality. The Advantage Local Server can be distributed royalty-free when accessing files located on a local workstation drive or on a network drive. The Advantage Local Server file that is installed with Advantage client products contains a physical limitation such that only five or fewer users can concurrently access any table. This limitation was implemented to allow developers the ability to encourage their customers to upgrade to the Advantage Database Server client/server solution when more than five concurrent users were being used so as to reduce data corruption, increase application performance, and reduce support costs. If you wish to have more than five concurrent users accessing data via the Advantage Local Server, inquire about such support with your Advantage Sales representative or Advantage distributor.

Database Knowledge Assumed in this Documentation

The concepts, terminology, and examples documented in this Help file were developed based on the assumption that the reader has a basic understanding of database theory. This includes concepts such as databases, tables, and indexes. It is also assumed that the reader has developed a database application. For information about these topics in relation to Delphi, see Developing Database Applications as well as the sample database applications included with your Delphi development kit.
