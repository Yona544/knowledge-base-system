Advantage Database Server is a relational database server, and like all other sophisticated database servers, it permits you to access your data using the industry standard SQL (which stands for structured query language, and which we are pronouncing sequel, although S-Q-L is also correct). In Part 2 of this book, you find a detailed look at Advantage SQL, the dialect of SQL you use with Advantage.

There are four chapters in this part, with each one playing a distinct role.

In Chapter 11, you learn how to construct valid Advantage SQL statements. Topics discussed in this chapter include how to reference table and field names, literal values, the available operators, and Advantage SQL scalar functions in the queries that you write. This chapter also discusses user defined functions and parameterized queries, SQL scripts, live versus static cursors, and subqueries. This chapter concludes with a look at the various SQL-related tools provided by the Advantage Data Architect.

Chapter 12 introduces you to the basic classes of SQL statements, and shows you some of the more common SQL queries that you can use in your applications.

In Chapter 13, you learn the ins and outs of SQL scripts, including SQL persistent stored modules (PSMs) and user defined functions (UDFs).

Chapter 14 discusses how to obtain metadata using SQL queries, as well as how to control data dictionaries and their objects.

If you are a seasoned SQL developer, you will probably want to quickly scan these chapters to learn the specifics of Advantage SQL and see the available SQL utilities.

If you are new to SQL programming, these chapters will get you started. Note, however, that these chapters merely provide an introduction. A thorough discussion of SQL would take several volumes. Consequently, if you want to get the most out of SQL, you may want to consider picking up a good book on SQL, such as The Practical SQL Handbook: Using Structured Query Language, by Judith S. Bowman, Sandra L. Emerson, and Marcy Darnovsky (Addison-Wesley, 2000).
