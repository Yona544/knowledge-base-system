The Advantage ODBC Driver allows SQL commands to be executed on any of the table types supported by Advantage.

SQL commands will be executed on Advantage data; therefore, there are a few notable differences when responding to SQL requests. The following areas are described in more detail below:

- [Database Directory](odbc_database_directory.md)

- [Index Types](odbc_index_types.md)

- [Locking](odbc_locking.md)

- [Deleted Records](odbc_deleted_records.md)

- [Character Sets](odbc_character_sets.md)

- [Driver Boundaries](odbc_driver_boundaries.md)

- [Index Optimizations](odbc_index_optimizations.md)

For information about supported data types, see [Supported Data Types in the Advantage SQL Engine](master_supported_data_types_in_the_advantage_sql_engine.md)
