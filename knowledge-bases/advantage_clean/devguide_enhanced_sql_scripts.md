A SQL script consists of two or more SQL statements, separated by semicolons. Advantage SQL scripts now support the creation of PSMs (persistent stored modules), an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard for adding a procedural capability to the SQL language.

These enhanced SQL scripts can now include variable declaration and assignment, conditional and looping control structures, cursor manipulation, and exception handling. These scripts can then be executed directly, or used to create stored procedure, triggers, or user-defined functions. Advantage SQL scripting capabilities are discussed in detail in Chapter 13.
