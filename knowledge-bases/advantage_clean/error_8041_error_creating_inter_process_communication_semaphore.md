Problem: Advantage Database Server failed to create a semaphore for inter-process communications (IPC) with clients running on the same physical workstation. This error is logged for informational purposes and is not returned to the client. The entry preceding this error in the error log will show the specific system error code.

Solution: This error can occur if a client application has stopped responding and has been disconnected by Advantage Database Server. The client application will hold the IPC objects for a specific connection entry and prevent future use of them. Close the unresponsive client application to free up the IPC objects.
