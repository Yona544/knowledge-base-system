The Advantage TDataSet Descendant provides access to two advanced property editors for creating and changing table metadata, as well as for testing and debugging SQL statements. These property editors are the same dialogs you are familiar with from the Advantage Data Architect, but are exposed inside the Delphi IDE for convenience and to help maintain your work flow.
