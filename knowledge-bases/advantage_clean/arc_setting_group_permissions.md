Group permissions can be set at the time the group is created, or anytime thereafter.

To update Group Rights, open a database. See [Opening a Database](arc_opening_a_database2.md) for details. You must login to the database as a user with ALTER permissions on the specific group in order to update group rights in a database. From the tree view within the Connection Repository, right-click the Group's name icon and select Properties. Then click the Permissions button on the Group Screen.
