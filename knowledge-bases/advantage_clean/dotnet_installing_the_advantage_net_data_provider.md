| 1. | Proceed through the introductory windows that appear on the screen. To properly perform string comparisons with local languages, Advantage provides OEM/localized character sets to match your country's language requirements. If your Advantage application uses OEM/localized character sets with Advantage Local Server, select the character set that matches your Advantage applications. Selecting a specific OEM/Localized character set for all Advantage installs will guarantee the OEM/Localized character sets used by all Advantage applications will be the same. |

Â 

| 2. | To properly perform string comparisons when using ANSI collation, Advantage provides ANSI character sets to match your country's language requirements. If your Advantage application uses ANSI character sets with Advantage Local Server, select an ANSI character set to be used by the Advantage Local Server. If <CURRENT SYSTEM LANGUAGE> is chosen, the currently configured ANSI character set will be used. If you do not wish to use the ANSI character set that is currently active, then select a specific character set from the list. Selecting a specific ANSI language for all Advantage installs, rather than selecting <CURRENT SYSTEM LANGUAGE>, will guarantee the ANSI character sets used by all Advantage applications will be the same. It is recommended that <CURRENT SYSTEM LANGUAGE> not be chosen unless all clients are running the same Windows operating system with the same regional settings configured. |
