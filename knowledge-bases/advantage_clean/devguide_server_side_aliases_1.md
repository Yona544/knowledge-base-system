Server-side aliases are special words that you define on your server that contain information about where your data is located on the network. When a client application passes this symbol to the server in a connection string, the server substitutes the symbol with the stored path information. This feature eliminates the need for shares, and keeps the location of the data hidden from the client applications. Server-side aliases also permit you to access your Advantage data stored on a network attached storage (NAS) device.

You will find a description of setting up server-side aliases in   
Appendix B.
