Problem: A general unknown error occurred in the OpenSSL library.

Solution: The error log may contain more detailed information with additional error numbers. Refer to the [OpenSSL error information](error_openssl_errors.md).

Problem: The server failed to load the TLS certificate ([TLS\_KEY\_FILE](master_tls_key_file.md)) and logged 7163 errors on startup.

Solution: Verify that the path and name for the certificate file is correct. The full path must be included. If Advantage is running as a service in Windows, for example, the default directory may not be the folder containing the certificate.
