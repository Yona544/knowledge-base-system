Problem: The version of the Advantage Client Kit driver is newer than the version of the Advantage server. The version of the Advantage server must be the same or greater than the version of the Advantage Client Kit driver.

Solution: Start/load a version of the Advantage server on your file server that is the same or greater than the version of the Advantage Client Kit driver. The ADSVER.EXE utility supplied in your Advantage directory can be used to determine the version of the Advantage server and the Advantage Client Kit driver linked into your application.
