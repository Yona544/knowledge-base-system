While Advantage requires little in the way of periodic maintenance to keep it running smoothly, many applications need to provide administrative functionality related to the management of users, groups, and objects.

In the first, a new table is added to the database and all groups are granted access rights to it. This operation requires that you establish an administrative connection. The second operation involves permitting individual users to modify their own passwords. Especially in the security-conscious world of modern database management, this feature is often considered an essential step to protecting data.
