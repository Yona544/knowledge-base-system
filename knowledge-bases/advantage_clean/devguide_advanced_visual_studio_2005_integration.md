With Visual Studio 2005, Advantage's integration goes even further. You can install Advantage data connections into the Visual Studio 2005 Server Explorer. With Advantage data connection added to the Server Explorer, you can easily view your database's metadata from within Visual Studio, including the names of tables, views, and stored procedures, as well as field and parameters names and data types.

Figure 18-2 shows a data connection to the DemoDictionary data dictionary in the Server Explorer.
