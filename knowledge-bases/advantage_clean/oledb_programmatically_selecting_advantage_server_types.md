Advantage server types can be selected programmatically using one of two methods: setting the ServerType property in the Connection string or setting the value for the ADS\_SERVER\_TYPE key in the ADS.INI file. The ADS\_SERVER\_TYPE setting in the ADS.INI will only be used if the ServerType property is not set in the application.
