| IP  Advantage Database Server |  |  |  |  |

The Advantage Database Server (ADS) must be setup to communicate with the clients through an IP address and port combination. On a computer with only one IP address, ADS automatically uses that IP address. (See [Setting the Internet Port Configuration Parameter](master_setting_the_internet_port_configuration_parameter.md) for instructions on configuring the IP port.)

If there is a firewall between Advantage Database Server and the Internet, a suitable IP port will need to be opened in the firewall that will be used by Advantage Database Server. This is standard issue for many Internet products and is not unique to Advantage Database Server. The standard port that Web page servers use, for example, is port 80. If there is a firewall between the Web server and the Internet, the Internet service provider must open port 80 through the firewall.
