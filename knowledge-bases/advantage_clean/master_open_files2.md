"Open Files" displays the currently opened tables or index files. Preceding the file name is the Advantage Locking Mode by which the file was opened. The Advantage Proprietary Locking is denoted with "ADS", and Advantage Compatibility Locking is denoted with "CDX" for IDX/CDX file compatibility locking or "NTX" for NTX file compatibility locking. It also indicates which users currently have the files open.

By selecting either "Open Data Files" or "Open Index Files", a list of the files will appear on the screen. To find out who has the files open, select the file (by pressing Enter) and the connected user will display.
