A remote database server like ADS is an application specifically designed to provide other applications with access to one or more databases. Those other applications are referred to as clients, and most client applications are end user applications. This configuration, where clients request data from a remote server, is referred to as client/server architecture. (Note that the client may also be a Windows service, a Web server extension, or a Web service.)

The client/server architecture offers many advantages, but the most important is reliability. With ADS, you have confidence that your data is secure and accessible.
