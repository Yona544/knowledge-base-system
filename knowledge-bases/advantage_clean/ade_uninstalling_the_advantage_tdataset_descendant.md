Performing the following steps can uninstall the Advantage TDataSet Descendant:

| 1. | Click the Start button on the Task Bar. |

| 2. | Select Settings, Control Panel. |

| 3. | Select Add/Remove Programs. The name of the Advantage software will depend on what Delphi product was installed. |

To remove the Advantage directory from the library path:

| 1. | Start the IDE and select Tools then Environment Options. |

| 2. | Click the Library tab. Locate the C:\Program Files\Advantage X.x\TDataSet\ path and delete it from the library path. |

To remove other Advantage files:

| 1. | Delete the C:\Program Files\Advantage X.x\TDataSet\<Delphi\_product> directory. |

| 2. | If the Advantage TDataSet Descendant is the only Advantage product installed, delete the C:\Program Files\Advantage X.x directory and all of its subdirectories. |

| 3. | See [Installed Files](ade_installed_files_for_advantage_tdataset_descendant.md) for other files to delete that are in the C:\WINDOWS and C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories. |

| 4. | Remove the Advantage package and source path. |
