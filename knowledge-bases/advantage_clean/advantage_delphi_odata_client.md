Product Overview

Â 

Enter topic text here.Advantage Database Server's Delphi TDataSet Descendant is a solid offering, but lacks support for anything outside of Windows development. Given Embarcadero's cross-platform strategy, it is imperative for ADS to align with this direction. The Delphi OData Client client architecture offers users to interact with the data using familiar TDataSet data stores. It is built using the classes exposed by Delphi REST client package, initially released with Delphi XE5.
