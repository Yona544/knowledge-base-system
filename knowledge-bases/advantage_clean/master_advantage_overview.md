The Advantage product line includes the Advantage Database Server, Advantage Local Server, and a variety of Advantage clients.

The Advantage Database Server is a scalable, high performance client/server RDBMS for networked, stand-alone, Internet and mobile database applications. The Advantage Database Server supports the Windows and Linux operating systems.

The Advantage Local Server is a non-client/server solution for accessing data located on local drives as well as computers on the network that are not running the Advantage Database Server. The Advantage Local Server allows both single-user and multiple-user access to data files. There is no cost for the Advantage Local Server. The Advantage Local Server is installed with all Advantage Windows and Linux client products (which are also free). This allows you to develop applications for single and multi-user environments and distribute them royalty-free when using the Advantage Local Server.

Advantage client solutions are native and seamless in their integration into existing applications allowing replacement of existing database drivers with fully compatible Advantage drivers. Advantage clients also allow for quick and easy development of new applications in a wide variety of development environments. Available Advantage clients include native, integrated solutions for Delphi, Kylix, C++Builder, CA-Clipper, and CA-Visual Objects. Windows and Linux development platforms can also access the Advantage Database Server and Advantage Local Server via a variety of Advantage clients including (but not limited to) the Advantage Client Engine API, the Advantage ODBC Driver, the Advantage Perl DBI Driver, the Advantage OLE DB Provider, the Advantage JDBC Driver, and the Advantage .NET Data Provider.
