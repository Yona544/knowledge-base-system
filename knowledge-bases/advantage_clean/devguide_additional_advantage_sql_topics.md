In addition to the topics covered earlier in this chapter, there are some additional things that you should know before you continue on to Chapters 12 through 14. These include the SQL statement dimensions, live versus static cursors, the SQL execution plan, temporary tables, SubQueries, and Advantage Query Tools. Advantage Query Tools are discussed in the final section of this chapter. The remaining topics are covered next.
