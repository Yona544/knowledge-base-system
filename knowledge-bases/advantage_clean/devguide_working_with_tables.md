You use the Table Browser to work with your Advantage tables. In addition to entering and editing data in your table, you can use the Table Browser to perform a variety of table-related maintenance tasks, including modifying the table's structure, adding one or more index orders, packing the table (removing deleted records), rebuilding its index files, and encrypting and decrypting the table.

This section describes the basic use of the Table Browser, including how to open tables in it, as well as how to navigate and edit those tables. Using the table maintenance features of the Table Browser is discussed later in this chapter.
