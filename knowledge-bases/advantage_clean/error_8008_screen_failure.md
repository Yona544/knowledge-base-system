Errors in the 8000 range are returned when the Advantage server makes a direct call to an OS API, and that function returns a failure. If you receive an error in the 8000 range, retry the database operation. If the error condition persists, please send a small re-creation to Advantage [Technical Support](master_technical_support_u_s__and_canada.md) demonstrating the problem so that Advantage R&D can investigate the issue.
