For rowsets created using the ICommand::Execute method, the properties desired in the resulting rowset can constrain the text of the command. This is especially critical for consumers that support dynamic command text.

The Advantage OLE DB Provider cannot use the Advantage Database Server cursors to support the multiple-rowset results generated by many commands. If a consumer requests a rowset requiring Advantage Database Server cursor support, an error will occur if the command text used generates more than a single rowset as its result.

Scrollable Advantage OLE DB Provider rowsets are supported by Advantage Database Server cursors.
