| Reserved Keywords  Advantage SQL Engine |  |  |  |  |

The following keywords are reserved by the Advantage SQL engine and cannot be used as identifiers in SQL statements unless they are enclosed in double quotes or [] brackets. For example, SELECT "user" FROM test. Note that this is the current list and will probably expand in the future as functionality is added.

To retrieve a list of reserved keywords from the Advantage SQL Engine call the system procedure, [sp\_GetSQLKeywords](master_sp_getsqlkeywords.md).
