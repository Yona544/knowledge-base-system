All of the windows in the SQL Utility can be docked or pulled out of their docking site and left as floating windows.

To move a window:

| 1. | Position your mouse over the title bar for the window, or over the windows selection tab. |

| 2. | Hold down the left mouse button and drag the window away from its current dock site. At this point multiple potential dock sites will be shown. |

| 3. | To dock at a specific site, drag the window to a dock site indicator and release the mouse button. |
