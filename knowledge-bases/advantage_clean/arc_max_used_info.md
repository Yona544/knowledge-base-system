# Arc Max Used Info

Max Used Info

Max Used Info

| Max Used Info |  |  |  |  |

The maximum number of resources actually in use at one time since the Advantage Database Server was loaded/started.

Note The "Max Used" information is provided to help system administrators fine-tune the configuration of the Advantage Database Server for optimal performance. For example, if after several days of active use, the maximum number of data locks in use at one time is 50, the system administrator could reconfigure the Advantage Database Server to allocate 55 data locks.
