| Removed Partial Connection Info |  |  |  |  |

When a client connects to the Advantage Database Server, a reply is sent to the client. The Advantage Database Server waits for a response from the client to acknowledge the reply has been received. If the client does not send a response, the Advantage Database Server terminates the connection. This is a symptom of an extremely busy network.
