Note AdsDDRemoveIndexFile requires exclusive open of the table. An error will be returned if the table cannot be opened exclusively.

Note This function can be called inside a transaction, but will not be part of the transaction. Any changes it makes cannot be rolled back.

Example

After making a connection to the database, find the first index file associated with the "Customer Information" table and disassociate it with the table.

AdsConnect60( "n:\\MyData\\myData.ADD", ADS\_REMOTE\_SERVER, "ADSSYS", NULL, ADS\_DEFAULT, &hDD );

usBufferSize = (UNSIGNED16)sizeof( aucIndexFileName );

if ( AE\_SUCCESS == AdsDDFindFirstObject( hDD, ADS\_DD\_INDEX\_FILE\_OBJECT,

"Customer Information", aucIndexfileName,

&usBufferSize, &hFindHandle ))

{

AdsDDRemoveIndexFile( hDD, "Customer Information", aucIndexFileName, FALSE ) ;

}

Â 

/\* No need to close the find handle since we are closing the DD now. \*/

AdsDisconnect( hDD );
