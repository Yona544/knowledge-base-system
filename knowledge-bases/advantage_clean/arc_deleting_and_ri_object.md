To delete an RI object, open a database. See [Opening a Database](arc_opening_a_database2.md) for details. You must login to the database as a user with ALTER permissions on both related tables in order to delete an RI object from a database. From the tree view within the Connection Repository, right-click the RI object's name icon and select Delete.
