A view is an object that contains a SQL SELECT statement that produces a result set containing zero or more records and at least one field. From the perspective of your applications, a view is like a table in your database.

This chapter shows you how to create and configure views. It begins by showing you how to define views. Later topics in this chapter include testing views, controlling view rights, querying views, and using views to link to tables outside of your data dictionary.

   
NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with SQL, you may also want to refer to Chapters 11, 12, 13, and 14 while reading this chapter.
