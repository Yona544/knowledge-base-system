This book is for anyone who wants to create better database applications without the complexity normally associated with the client/server architecture. If you are not currently using a remote database server, you are cheating yourself if you do not give Advantage a look. If you are currently using another database server, and are unhappy with the level of maintenance that it requires, you too should consider the benefits of the Advantage Database Server.

The code download for this book includes everything you need to give Advantage a try. The download (see Appendix A) includes a two-user developer license for the Windows NT/2000/2003 and Linux platforms. You can also download all utilities and associated client drivers, permitting you to access this server from almost every development environment imaginable.

If you do not need a remote database server just yet, this code download also includes ALS, the Advantage Local Server. (ALS is installed when you install any of the client drivers, with the exception of the Java client. Read the license.txt file located in the directory in which you install a client driver for further information.) ALS is a file server-based database engine that supports up to five simultaneous users, and can be deployed royalty-free. (Note, however, that the free ALS cannot be used in Internet applications or with the Advantage JDBC Java Driver.) Importantly, ALS and ADS have identical APIs (application programming interfaces), permitting you to effortlessly convert an ALS client to an ADS client.

The code download also includes the sample code listings and applications described in this book. In short, you will have everything you need to get started with Advantage today.

Get ready. The fun is about to begin!
