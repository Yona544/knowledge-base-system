The TLS\_CIPHERS configuration parameter can be used for defining which cipher suites are allowed for Transport Layer Security (TLS) [communications](master_communications_encryption.md). If multiple ciphers are allowed, they can be delimited with commas or colons. Â Valid values include:

- AES128-SHA - 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption and SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) for message authentication.

- AES256-SHA - 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption and SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) for message authentication.

- RC4-MD5 - 128-bit RC4 for encryption and MD5 for message authentication. Note that this is not a FIPS-compliant cipher.

These names can be shortened to just the encryption name (without the hash name). For example, to specify the AES ciphers:

TLS\_CIPHERS=AES128:AES256

This option is equivalent to the command line parameter /TLSCiphers
