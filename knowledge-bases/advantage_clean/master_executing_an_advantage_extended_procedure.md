Advantage Extended Procedures can be executed using SQL by using the [EXECUTE PROCEDURE](master_execute_procedure.md) statement.

Note to TDataSet Descendant users Advantage Extended Procedures can be executed via the TAdsStoredProc component when using the Advantage TDataSet Descendant. The TAdsStoredProc component is on the Advantage tab of your component palette. This component encapsulates a procedure call, and simplifies parameter passing through the use of TParam objects. Reference the TAdsStoredProc documentation in the Advantage TDataSet Descendant Help documentation (ADE.HLP) for more information. (Each of the Advantage products and their corresponding Help files are installed separately.)
