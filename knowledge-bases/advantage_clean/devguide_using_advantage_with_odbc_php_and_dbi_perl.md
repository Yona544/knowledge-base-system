Each of the preceding chapters in this section describes building client applications using an IDE (integrated development environment) such as Delphi, JBuilder, Visual Studio, or Visual Studio for .NET. This final chapter introduces you to a collection of related data access mechanisms that are not associated with a particular IDE, or even a specific operating system. These are the Advantage ODBC (open database connectivity) Driver, the Advantage PHP Extension, and the Advantage DBI Driver (for Perl).

As in the previous chapters on writing Advantage client applications, this chapter is not intended to show you how to program in the environments supporting the covered drivers, focusing instead on how to connect to and use Advantage. For information on developing in the languages covered in this chapter, refer to the documentation or a good book on the subject.
