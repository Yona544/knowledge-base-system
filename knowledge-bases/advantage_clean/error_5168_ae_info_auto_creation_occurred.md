This error code is never returned to the client. It will only appear in error logs should a dictionary tables auto-creation property be set to True and the tables file and/or index files not exist and require re-creation.

Note This code serves as verification that auto-creation successfully took place. It is a sign that auto-creation is working properly and to list any files that were re-created.

Â 

Note This code is preceded by several "File Not Found" error codes in the error log (7041 errors). This is normal behavior.
