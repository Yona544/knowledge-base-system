"Client" normally refers to workstations and applications that are attached to a network. "Server" is the central repository of files that are commonly shared by the "client" applications. True client/server technology involves an intelligent division of processing between the client and the server. Optimizing your network resources and performance depends on a complete understanding of the relationship of "clients" to "servers". For example, certain operations are ideally suited to reside on the client; such as the user interface and most business rules and operations. Operations involving database access are most appropriately performed on the server where the data files are located. By contrast, in a non-client/server application, all database operations are executed on the client while the server simply stores the tables for sharing among others on the network.

The Advantage Database Server optimizes your client/server architecture by increasing multi-user performance, database stability, and database security while making it easy to install and integrate Advantage into your existing applications. Performance improvements are achieved primarily by reducing network traffic, intelligently maintaining database files, and by providing intelligent lock management.
