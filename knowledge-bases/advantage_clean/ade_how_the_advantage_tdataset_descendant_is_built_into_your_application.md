There are two ways to include the Advantage TDataSet Descendant in your application; you can build the source files directly into your project, or you can reference a runtime library that contains the Advantage TDataSet Descendant functionality.

VCL/CLX

When using the VCL or CLX, the Advantage source files are compiled with your project and linked directly into your application. In this case, you only need to distribute the files listed in the [Distributing Advantage TDataSet Descendant Applications](ade_distributing_advantage_tdataset_descendant_applications.md) topic.

An alternative to this approach would be to instead link your application to the Advantage runtime BPL. For more information on using runtime BPLs from Delphi, see the "About packages" topic group in the "Programming with Delphi" section of the Delphi DevGuide help file.
