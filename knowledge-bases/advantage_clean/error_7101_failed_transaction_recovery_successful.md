Problem: The Advantage Database Server successfully performed a Failed Transaction Recovery upon server startup. This warning will typically be logged to the Advantage Database Server error log file, when a failed transaction recovery was necessary due to a server crash while one or more transactions were in progress. If this warning is logged, it means that upon restarting, the Advantage Database Server was able to successfully recover all transactional data, and the database should be a known and stable state. This warning is logged for informational purposes only. See [Advantage Transaction Processing System Features](master_advantage_transaction_processing_system_features.md) for additional information.

Solution: None.
