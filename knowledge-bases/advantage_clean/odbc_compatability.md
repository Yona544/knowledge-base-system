The Advantage ODBC Driver can make updates to any index that can be built on the Advantage Database Server. See your Advantage Database Server documentation for more information on index building. Because of the inherent differences between SQL and Xbase, not every index order can be used to optimize queries. See [Index Optimizations](odbc_index_optimizations.md) for more information.
