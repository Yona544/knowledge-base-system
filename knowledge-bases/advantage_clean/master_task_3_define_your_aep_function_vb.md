# Master Task 3 Define Your Aep Function Vb

Task 3: Define Your AEP Function

Task 3: Define Your AEP Function

Advantage Concepts

| Task 3: Define Your AEP Function  Advantage Concepts |  |  |  |  |

Every AEP has a pre-defined function prototype:

Public Function MyProcedure(ByVal ulConnectionID As Int32, \_

ByVal hConnection As Int32, \_

ByRef ulNumRowsAffected As Int32) As Int32

Â 

Each parameter is described in detail in the general [Advantage Extended Procedures](master_advantage_extended_procedures.md) documentation. We wont describe each parameter here; well address these parameters as they are used throughout the rest of the tutorial.

The AEP template that was created for you already contains one procedure entrypoint, MyProcedure. We will enhance this existing procedure in later sections.
