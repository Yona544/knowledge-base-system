The book's download site includes two files that contain the database and all associated sample code files.

For Windows developers, this compressed file is a self-extracting executable named adsbook.exe. For Linux developers, there is a compressed tar file named adsbook.tar.gz. Download the file appropriate for your environment. The contents of these two files are identical. You can download either the adsbook.exe or adsbook.tar.gz file from the following URL:

http://www.AdvantageDatabase.com/book

If you are a Windows developer, run adsbook.exe. This is a self-extracting WinZIP file that will extract its contents into a directory named c:\AdsBook by default. If you wish to install the samples into some alternative directory, use the provided dialog box to select the alternative directory into which you want the files extracted.

For Linux developers, use the following instructions to install the sample files from this tar file:

1.        In Linux, use your tool of choice to copy adsbook.tar.gz to the directory where you want to extract the files. For example, you may want to place this file in the following directory: /usr/local/adsbook/.

| 2. | Make the directory into which you copied adsbook.tar.gz the current directory. |

| 3. |  |
