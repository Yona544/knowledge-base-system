# Master Tls Key File

TLS\_Key\_File

| TLS\_Key\_File  Advantage Database Server |  |  |  |  |

The TLS\_KEY\_FILE configuration parameter specifies the path to the file containing the private key and the signed certificate for Transport Layer Security (TLS) communications. Â See [Communications Encryption](master_communications_encryption.md) for more details. If the key file is located in the same folder as the Advantage Database Server binary, it is not necessary to include the file path (the file name alone is sufficient).

This option is equivalent to the command line parameter /TLSKeyFile
