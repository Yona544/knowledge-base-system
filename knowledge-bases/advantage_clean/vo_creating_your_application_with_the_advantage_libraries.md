| Creating your Application with the Advantage Libraries  Advantage Visual Objects and Vulcan.NET RDD |  |  |  |  |

You may create an Advantage Visual Objects or Vulcan.NET application using one of two methods: using the [DB Server Editor](vo_db_server_editor.md) via the IDE or [writing code](vo_writing_code.md) explicitly. The Advantage RDD is easily selected with either method. If the Advantage server is not available when one of the Advantage RDDs is specified, the processing can take place on the client, allowing you to build totally scalable applications. See [Advantage Server Types](master_advantage_server_types.md) for more information.
