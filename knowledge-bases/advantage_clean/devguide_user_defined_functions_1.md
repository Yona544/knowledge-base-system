User defined functions (UDFs) are reusable SQL routines that you create within a data dictionary. Once created, your UDFs can be used in any context where the SQL scalar functions supported by the Advantage query engine are acceptable, such as in the field list of a SQL SELECT statement or the WHERE clause of a DELETE statement.

Support for UDFs was introduced in Advantage 8.1. Creating and managing UDFs is discussed in detail in Chapter 13.
