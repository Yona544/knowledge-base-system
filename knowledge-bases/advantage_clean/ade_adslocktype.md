[AdsTableOptions](ade_adstableoptions.md)

Indicates which type of table locking to perform.

Syntax

type TAdsLockTypes = ( Proprietary, Compatible );

Â 

property AdsTableOptions.AdsLockType;

Description

Type of locking to use. Options are Proprietary locking and Compatible locking. If the application needs to share data in a writable mode with non-Advantage applications, then Compatible locking should be used. If the table will be used only by Advantage applications or by non-Advantage applications in a read-only mode, then Proprietary locking should be used. See [Advantage Locking Modes](master_advantage_locking_modes.md) for more information.

For Advantage proprietary ADT tables, this setting is ignored. When an ADT table is opened with Advantage Database Server (i.e., remote server), proprietary locking is always used. When an ADT table is opened with Advantage Local Server, compatible locking is used to allow other Advantage applications using the Advantage Local Server to open the same table.
